  <title>How to install the "dispatcher"</title>
  <abstract>
    This How-To describes the setup of the plugins (needed to work with forrest:views and forrest:contracts) and a fresh v2 seed site.
  </abstract>
  <last-modified-content-date date="2006-02-14"/>

  <audience title="Intended Audience">

<warning>
The "Dispatcher" (aka "Views") is new functionality which is still in development phase. That is why it is in the
"whiteboard" section of the Forrest distribution. This HowTo is a good start but still needs more work.
</warning>
    <p>
      Developers who want to get started with "dispatcher" development and want to help testing and developing the "dispatcher".
    </p>
  </audience>
  
  <purpose title="Purpose">
    <p>
      Quick guide installing the "dispatcher". This is the "getting started" setup guide.
    </p>
  </purpose>

  <prerequisites title="Prerequisites">
    <ul>
      <li>Need the SVN trunk version of Forrest for using the "dispatcher" because it is in an early stage.</li>
      <li>Read <a href="site:v0.80//buildPlugin">How to Build a Plugin</a>
        especially the section about using Forrest's own Ant.</li>
      <li>Installing a mozilla browser and the
        <a href="site:tools/forrestbar">Forrestbar</a> helps a lot in developing.</li>
    </ul>
  </prerequisites>

  <steps title="Steps">
    <p>
      The process of setting up the plugin should be easy. Still it has too many stages and it
       will become easier in the future.
    </p>
    <section id="localBuild">
      <title>Build the internal.dispatcher and the themes.core plugins</title>
      <p>
        The first step is to build and deploy the internal.dispatcher and the themes.core plugins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do your usual 'svn update' on forrest (build it clean and normal), then ...
      </p>

       <source>
cd whiteboard/plugins/org.apache.forrest.plugin.internal.dispatcher/
$FORREST_HOME/tools/ant/bin/ant local-deploy
cd ../org.apache.forrest.themes.core/
$FORREST_HOME/tools/ant/bin/ant local-deploy
      </source>
    </section>
    <section id="newSeed">
      <title>Seed a new project</title>
      <p> Go to the directory where you want to seed a new project and seed it ...
      </p>
      <source>cd ~/src/ 
mkdir dispatcher
cd dispatcher/ 
forrest seed </source>
    </section>
    <section id="forrestProperties">
      <title>Modify forrest.properties</title>
      <p>
        Make sure to tell forrest to use the dispatcher plugins. <br/>
        Edit forrest.properties to add the required plugins:
      </p>
      <source>
project.required.plugins=org.apache.forrest.themes.core,org.apache.forrest.plugin.internal.dispatcher
      </source>
    </section>
    <section id="testing">
      <title>Test your new "dispatcher" based project</title>
      <p> 
        Now you have finished the preparation and the setup to finally do
        <code>'forrest run'</code> and
        point your browser to <code>http://localhost:8888/</code> and you will see the default
        dispatcher-based site.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="availableContracts">
      <title>Available contracts</title>
      <p> 
       To start working with the dispatcher, you need to know which contracts you can use. 
       Forrestbar is a nice way to see available contracts. See the menu point "Devs"
       (ls.contracts and/or ls.contracts.project)
      </p><p>
        You can point your browser to e.g. <code>http://localhost:8888/ls.contracts.html</code> 
        ... On this page you will find all contracts that you can use in your project provided by the core themes.
      </p>
