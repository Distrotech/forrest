    <title>Status of Themes: Skins and Dispatcher</title>

      <title>Skins</title>
      <p>"Skins" is the term used to describe the current method for adding 
        navigation and menu information to the content of a page and applying a 
        consistent theme for layout, colours, etc. The <a 
        href="site:skins">"pelt" skin</a> is the only one that the Forrest 
        project is maintaining. It is configurable enough to meet many 
        purposes. The main configuration file for skins is the skinconf.xml 
        (themes have a similar configuration file called structurer). There is 
        an ability for users to create their own skins, although we have not 
        encouraged that.</p>
      <p>For the Forrest-0.8 release, skins are still available and are still the main mechanism.
      No effort has been made to enhance skins.</p>

    <section id="dispatcher">
      <title>Dispatcher</title>
      <p>"Dispatcher" is the term used to describe a new method which aims to 
        be a more flexible and complete solution to build a reliable common 
        structure for documents, incorporate other content, and provide hooks 
        for applying themes. Themes get configurated by structurer definitions 
        (a wee bit like the skinconf.xml). Although strong progress has been 
        made, it is still under development. We encourage developers to use 
        Dispatcher and contribute to its development. See the howto <a 
        href="site:v0.80//dispatcher/quickstart">Dispatcher Quickstart</a>.</p>
