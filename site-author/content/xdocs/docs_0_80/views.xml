    <title>forrest:views (Draft - feature planned for 0.8)</title>

<warning>
"Views" are new functionality which is still in development phase. That is why it is in the
"whiteboard" section of the Forrest distribution.

      <p>
        As stated in the <a href="site:v0.80//documentation/skins">Skin documentation 
        </a> the aim of the Forrest skins is to provide
        many capabilities so that extra skins are not needed. Experience showed that many Forrest users 
        decided to create a new skin because the default skin did not offer the features that they wanted.
        We introduced skinconf.xml where the user could configure some features of skins but it was up 
        to the skin to support it. That led us to develop a new concept of creating skins that would 
        be more easily extensible by a user.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim of the "forrest:views" concept is to provide a flexible framework for creating
        site and page specific layout in different formats. Further it is a filter that limits the
        data-model to a minimum by only requesting what the strucuter (e.g. default.fv) need.

      <p>
        The problem with the forrest skins so far has been that "only" the design changed (html-skeleton),
        but still we had to write a completely new skin and implement all functionality.
        Another problem was that the functionality was not easily extensible by a user.
        We also decided to support a standard regarding naming conventions for css elements.
        This standard has been developed on the <a href="http://www.oscom.org/events/oscom4/proposals/skins">
        OSCOM website</a>, where you can find some more background information.

      <title>Definition of naming conventions</title>

        "A naming convention is an attempt to systematize names in a particular field so 
        they unambiguously convey similar information in a similar manner."

      <p>
        That led to the development of the "leather-dev" skin which established a semantic container approach for div elements. 
        The problems with leather-dev was pointed out on the mail 
          "<a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=forrest-dev&amp;m=111049344517653" >status on leather-dev?</a>".
