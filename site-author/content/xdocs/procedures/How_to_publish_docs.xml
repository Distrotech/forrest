            <p>All Documentation on Forrest and the Forrest-Project is managed as a Forrest project located in the
                site-author-directory of Forrest head. The Forrest-Website is updated by generating static pages from
                the site-author-project and committing them to the forrest/site SVN, which is then
                'svn checkout' on the forrest.apache.org webserver to create the website.</p>
            <p>In this document you'll learn how make this happen.</p>

            <p>Move some content over from <a href="../roles.html#documentation-coordinator">../roles.html#documentation-coordinator</a>.
            </p>
            <p>There have been a few explantions of our docs processing on the forrest-dev mail list.
              Need to glean the info from them. Here is the content of one:</p>
            <source>
                <![CDATA[
                To publish from trunk/site-author/
                
                Do once:
                # Create $FORREST_HOME/deploy.svn.settings file. These credentials
                # are needed by forrestbot so that it can do your 'svn add'
                # and 'svn commit' etc. to the forrest/site/ repository.
                # The deploy.svn.settings file looks like:
                <?xml version="1.0"?>
                <project>
                    <property name="deploy.svn.user" value="myApacheUsername"/>
                    <property name="deploy.svn.password" value="myPassword"/>
                </project>
                
                
                # Make changes to sources, and then test, then commit.
                # Best to wait on committing the source changes until
                # you have built and reviewed the docs.

                # Please, please, ensure valid xml docs. Errors will be
                # reported during the 'build' phase if you don't.
                # Also it prevents other people from working with the docs,
                # which goes against the collaborative development process.

                # You can do 'forrest validate-xdocs" beforehand or use
                # a validating editor (link: catalog.html) or for a single doc use
                # xmllint (link: catalog.html) from the command-line, e.g.
                # xmllint --noout --valid --catalogs faq.xml

                # Use the forrestbot to build and then deploy to svn.apache.org ...
                
                cd site-author
                forrest -f publish.xml build
                # ... verify files in build/forrest-docs
                forrest -f publish.xml deploy -Ddeploy.svn.commit-message="my commit message"
                
                Now the files are in SVN at forrest/site
                Periodically the real website files are updated from there.
                You do not have to do anything else.
                
                ----------------------
                Note: The first time that you deploy, it will need to do
                a long svn checkout first.
                
                FIXME: That commit message technique does not work.
                The second word is treated as an ant target to be called.
                Just leave it out and forrestbot will use a default message.
