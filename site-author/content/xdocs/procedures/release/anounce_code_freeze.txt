Subject: [Important] code-freeze commenced

The code-freeze is now happening to allow us to pack the
release candidates and make them available for testing.

Code-freeze means *no* non-essential commits to the trunk
or to the new release branch. Other branches are free to
continue.

There should be no code enhancements or new functionality,
because that could introduce new bugs.

The main aim is to find and fix important bugs. Any minor
issues are delayed until after release (add to Jira).

Documentation corrections can happen because they will not
break anything. As long as we do test the documentation
building just prior to making the final release candidate.

However, if there are important code changes that are required
you can make a proposal to allow that commit. The PMC will
make a quick decision.

Next important milestones are:

* Create release candidate #2 if there have been changes

Now we will go and build the releases which might take
some time. The next message will tell you where to get
the release candidates and describe how to test.
