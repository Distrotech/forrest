      This page describes some changes to Apache Forrest that affect people who are
      upgrading to the 0.7 version.
      If you have other issues, then please discuss on either the
      <a href="ext:mail-lists/forrest-dev">dev</a> or
      <a href="ext:mail-lists/forrest-user">user</a>
      mailing lists.
      As more experience is gained, this document will be updated.  
      </p>
      <p>
      (If you are upgrading from a version prior to 0.6 then you will need
      to see the notes for the <a href="site:upgrading_06">previous</a>
      upgrade.)

        The following list shows some of the key new features for Forrest 0.7

        <li>JDK 1.4</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As usual, do a "forrest seed site" in a new directory and compare the
        forrest.properties and skinconf.xml
      </p>

    <section id="clean">
      <title>Run a clean target after upgrade</title>
      <p>To avoid any issue with old classes being loaded, run a
        '<code>forrest clean</code>' in your project directory, after you
        upgraded to this version.

      <title>Configure plugins</title>
      <p>
       Some functionality has been moved out of the forrest core and into
       plugins. You will need to declare any plugins that are used by
       your project, e.g. if you use projectInfo (status, changes, todo)
       and PDF output, then declare the following in forrest.properties
      </p>
      <source>
project.required.plugins=org.apache.forrest.plugin.projectInfo,org.apache.forrest.plugin.pdf-output
      </source>

    <section id="raw">
      <title>Including raw un-processed content</title>
      <p>The method for including "raw un-processed content" has changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 0.6 version, the raw content was placed in the
        src/documentation/content/ directory and potential sub-directories.
        In the generated site, these links would automatically function.
        Any linked file with .html extension was not processed and not
        adorned with Forrest skin and navigation menus.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 0.7 version, any file that is linked to, needs to be placed in
        the content/xdocs/ directory structure.
        Any linked file with .html extension is now processed and is
        adorned with Forrest skin and navigation menus.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need to include files that are not linked to,
        then place them in the src/documentation/content/ directories
        as with the 0.6 version.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need to link to html files but want them to be un-processed,
        then place them in the src/documentation/content/ directories and
        add an entry to conf/cli.xconf to exclude them from processing.
        An FAQ describes the use of Cocoon's
        <a href="faq.html#ignoring_javadocs">cli.xconf</a>

      <p>
      Synchronise your project's skinconf.xml and forrest.properties files.
      </p>
      <p>
      Take advantage of the separation of concerns. In a new workspace,
      create a fresh
      '<code>forrest seed</code>' site, then tweak its forrest.properties
      and skinconf.xml until it reflects your old site.
      When it is ready, replace your project's skinconf.xml and
      forrest.properties files.
      Any remaining issues would concern other aspects of your configuration,
      such as site.xml and your actual content.

      <title>New location of $FORREST_HOME</title>
      <p>
      $FORREST_HOME is now the top-level of the distribution.
      Also make sure $PATH gets updated to use the new $FORREST_HOME/bin
