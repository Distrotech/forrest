      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>
        On the first Tuesday of each month we have a 24-hour get-together using
        the dev mailing list, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), and other collaborative
        tools, to work on Forrest development and get to know each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        ForrestTuesday starts at 09:00 UTC (9am Greenwich Mean Time in London)
        and lasts for 24 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next event will take place on <strong>6 September 2005</strong>. See 
        <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?year=2005&amp;month=9&amp;day=6&amp;hour=9&amp;min=0&amp;sec=0">start time</a>
        and

      <title>Purpose</title>
      <p>
        The day is devoted to working collaboratively to solve particular issues
        and getting to know each other. In the weeks leading up to each event,
        decide on the dev mailing list what the main topic should be. Probably
        something that needs groups work (e.g. moving the internal format to
        be XHTML2).
        There will also be an effort to clean up the
        <a href="site:bugs">Issue Tracker</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dev mailing list is still the main form of communication and all
        decisions are made there. The IRC channel is to support that and provide
        a place for near real-time discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The IRC channel is definitely not open continuously. It is only for
        temporary communications at this monthly meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a user help forum, please do that on the user mailing list.
