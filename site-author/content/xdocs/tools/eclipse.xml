          <title>Creating a new Forrest Project</title>
          <p>To create a new Forrest project select "New Project" from either the context menu in the package explorer or the
          "New" menu and select Forrest -> Seed New Project.</p>
          
          <p>A wizard will ask you for the name of the project and the location in which the project files are to be created
          (by default the files will be in your current workspace). If you click "Finish" at this point a basic project will
          be created. However, if you click "Next" you will be given the opportunity to select which plugins you wish to 
          include in the project.</p>

        <title>Editors</title>
        <p>A number of editors are provided for Forrest configuration files. This section describes those editors.</p>
        
        <section id="siteXMLEditor">
          <title>
            site.xml Editor
          </title>
          <p>
            First, you need to activate the Site.xml view. This can be done by:
            <code>
              Window -> Show View -> Other... -> Forrest -> SiteXML -> OK
            </code>
            Now you will see the the view open up in Eclipse. To view a tree, click on the project you are working and you should see the structure of the site.xml as a tree in the view.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two ways to add the note to the site.xml file.
          </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Drag a file from the Package Explorer to the tree. This will create a new element 
                with references to that dropped file(s).
              </li>
              <li>
                Right click on an element in the site.xml tree and select "Add Element". A wizard will come up which will allow you to enter the HREF, Description, Label and Element name for the new element that is being added.
              </li>

          <p>
            To delete an element, right click on the element in the tree and click on "Delete Element".
          </p>
          <warning>
            For the changes to show up when you run a test site for your project, you must save the changes. Right click on the tree and select
        "Save". In a later version of the plugin this step will not be necessary.
          </warning>
          <fixme author="Anil Ramnanan">
