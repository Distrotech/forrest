Subject: [Announce] Apache Forrest 0.8

Note: This development version may differ from the final announcement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Apache Forrest is pleased to release the new version: apache-forrest-0.8
http://forrest.apache.org/mirrors.cgi

Apache Forrest is a publishing framework that transforms
input from various sources into a unified presentation
in one or more output formats. The modular and extensible
plugin architecture is based on Apache Cocoon and relevant
standards, which separates presentation from content.
Forrest can generate static documents, or be used as a
dynamic server, or be deployed by its automated facility.

New features in this version include:

* Locationmaps define the mapping from requests to locations,
which enables content and resources to be located at various
different sources. The advantage of this is that the URL seen
by the user need bear no relation to the location of the source
document, thus Forrest can separate the client URL space from
the source document URL space. Thus, using the locationmap
it is possible to pull together documents from many different
locations into a single uniform site.In addition, since the
user URL space is now unconnected to the source URL space it is 
possible to move source documents without breaking any existing
user links.
