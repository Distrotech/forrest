   <h2>What is this?</h2>
   <p>Forrest is an XML standards-oriented project documentation framework 
      based on Apache Cocoon, providing XSLT stylesheets and schemas, images 
      and other resources. Forrest uses these to render the XML source content 
      into a website via command-line, robot, or a dynamic web application.</p>

   <h2>What do I do now?</h2>
   <p>You are using a "source" distribution of Forrest. You need to first 
      build Forrest, by typing <pre>   'build.bat'</pre> (Windows)
      or <pre>   './build.sh'</pre> (Unix).</p>

   <p>
     Follow the instructions to set environment variables FORREST_HOME and PATH.
   </p>

   <p>Forrest is now ready to go! Here are three things to try ...</p>
   
   <h3>Render the Forrest documentation</h3>
   <p>Simply type <pre>   'forrest'</pre> in this (Forrest's source distribution) 
      top-level directory. This will render the HTML and PDFs to
      <pre>   build/site/</pre>
      Point your web browser to the index.html file there.
   </p>

    <h3>Run a webapp of the Forrest site</h3>
    <p>Type <pre>   'forrest run'</pre> in this top-level directory.
      You can then point your browser to 
      <a href="http://localhost:8888/">http://localhost:8888/</a>
      and view the Forrest website generated dynamically. Experiment with
      editing docs in 
      <pre>   src/documentation/content/xdocs/</pre> and watch them be
      instantly rendered.
     </p>

      <h3>Generate your own site</h3>
      <p>Create a new (empty) directory in your home space, cd to it, and type
       <pre>   'forrest seed'</pre> 
         This will generate a skeleton directory structure and template XML. 
         If you like, edit the XML in
         <pre>   src/documentation/content/xdocs/</pre>
         Now type <pre>   'forrest'</pre> to render your new site,
         or <pre>   'forrest run'</pre>
         to generate a <a href="http://localhost:8888/">webapp</a>.</p>

   <p>For further information please read our 
   <a href="http://xml.apache.org/forrest/your-project.html">Getting Started</a>
   guide. If you have any questions or suggestions, please subscribe to the 
   <a href="http://xml.apache.org/forrest/mail-lists.html">Forrest mailing lists</a>.</p>

   <p>Thanks for using Apache Forrest!</p>
