   <h2>What is this?</h2>
   <p>Apache Forrest is an XML standards-oriented documentation framework
     based upon Apache Cocoon, providing XSLT stylesheets and schemas,
     images and other resources. Forrest uses these to render the source
     content into a website via command-line, robot, or dynamic application.
   </p>

   <h2>What do I do now?</h2>
   <p>With a downloaded distribution, Forrest is already built. Just set the
     environment variables for convenience: FORREST_HOME to point to src/core
     and add FORREST_HOME/bin to your PATH. That is it, ready.
   </p>
   <p>The source code is also provided, so you can alter it or extend it,
      and then re-build by doing
      <tt>'build.bat'</tt> (Windows)
      or <tt>'./build.sh'</tt> (Unix).
      If you need more instructions, then see the
      <a href="http://forrest.apache.org/build.html">Building Forrest</a>
      document.
   </p>

   <p>Forrest is ready to go! Here are some things to try ...</p>
   
   <h3>Render the Forrest core documentation</h3>
   <p>Simply type <tt>'forrest'</tt> in this
      top-level directory. This will render the HTML and PDFs for the Forrest
      documentation into the
      <tt>build/site/</tt> directory.
      Point your web browser to the index.html file.
   </p>

    <h3>Run a webapp of the Forrest site</h3>
    <p>Type <tt>'forrest run'</tt> in this top-level directory.
      You can then point your browser to 
      <a href="http://localhost:8888/">http://localhost:8888/</a>
      and view the Forrest website generated dynamically.
     </p>

      <h3>Generate your own site</h3>
      <p>Create a new (empty) directory in your home space, cd to it, and type
       <tt>'forrest seed'</tt>
       which will generate a skeleton directory structure and template XML. 
       If you like, edit the XML in the
       <tt>src/documentation/content/xdocs/</tt> directory.
       Now type <tt>'forrest'</tt> to render your new site,
       or <tt>'forrest run'</tt>
       to generate a <a href="http://localhost:8888/">webapp</a> then
       experiment with editing docs in
       <tt>src/documentation/content/xdocs/</tt> and watch them be
       instantly rendered.
     </p>
