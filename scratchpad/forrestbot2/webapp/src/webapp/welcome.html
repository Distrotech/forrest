<p>
This site contains automatically updated and built versions of websites built
with the latest <a href="http://xml.apache.org/forrest/">Forrest</a>. It aims
to provide a service similar to <a
  href="http://jakarta.apache.org/gump/">Gump</a>, but for websites.  Hosted
projects' source is automatically checked out and the HTML rebuilt periodically.
</p>
<p>
In addition, if you have just made a site update and are itching to see the
result, site builds can be triggered manually.  Certain users can also
trigger a publish of the generated files.

To set up the Forrestbot Web Inteface for your own collection of projects, checkout the source and read README.txt
