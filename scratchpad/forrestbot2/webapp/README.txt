                            Forrestbot web interface

                            ------------------------

This webapp implements a website staging application for sites built with
Apache Forrest. The webapp hosts HTML for a number of managed websites.  The
user can regenerate these sites at will.  Once the user is satisfied with the
site, they may 'deploy' the site, making it live.

Build
-----
To build the webapp from source, you need maven installed.  From a command prompt,
enter this directory and execute "maven war".
The 'eclipse' plugin for maven is used to generate eclipse workspace files.  If you
use eclipse, you may want to familiarize yourself with that plugin.
