Until this file disappears, CVS Forrest
 should be regarded as highly unstable,
as it is going through major refactoring.

        Backwards-compatibility
with 0.4 user-overridden sitemaps HAS been
broken, and no attempts will be made to
 preserve backwards-compat until a 0.5
            release is made.

 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
