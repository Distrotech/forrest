      <p>
        You can include raw HTML, PDFs, plain-text, and other files.
        They are included in the Forrest-built site, by placing them in the
        <code>src/documentation/content/</code> directory and
        they will be copied over automatically. You can link to them as
        normal, e.g.
        <strong>&lt;link href="test3.html"&gt;</strong><link href="test3.html">test3.html</link><strong>&lt;/link&gt;</strong>
        and
        <strong>&lt;link href="../hello.pdf"&gt;</strong><link href="../hello.pdf">hello.pdf</link><strong>&lt;/link&gt;</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also have sub-directories such as 
        <code>src/documentation/content/samples/subdir/</code> which
        reflects your main
        <code>xdocs/</code> tree. The raw files will then end up
        beside your documents.
