        You can include raw HTML, PDFs, plain-text, and other files in Forrest
        output by placing them in <code>src/documentation/content</code> and
        they will be copied over automatically. You can then link to them as
        normal, e.g.
        <link href="../hello.pdf">&lt;link href="hello.pdf"/&gt;</link> and
        <link href="../test1.html">&lt;link href="test1.html/&gt;</link>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also have sub-directories such as 
        <code>src/documentation/content/connectors</code> which reflects your
        <code>xdocs/connectors</code> tree. The raw files will then end up
        beside your documents.
