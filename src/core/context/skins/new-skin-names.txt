Before inventing a dull name for a skin or trying to discuss it on
the dev list, remember that we have already lost time on it.

We are not that good at picking names it seems, so we decided to 
use names akin to 'skin'.

Just pick one of these, it's easy.

If you still cannot decide, toss a dice 3 times, sum up the 
numbers, and get the name that comes out.

1 fleece
2 rind
3 fur
4 hide
5 coat
6 pelt -> taken
7 peel
8 bark
9 exo
10 derma
11 dermis
12 corium
13 calyx
14 scale
15 leather
16 patina
17 crust -> taken
18 hull
19 husk

We may be unable to come out with a decent name, but we sure know how 
to eliminate the problem for the next occasions in a hacky way. :-P
