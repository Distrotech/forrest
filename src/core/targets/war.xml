Please keep in mind that you may have to copy some jar files to
wherever your servlet container looks for "endorsed" libraries. These
files are found in ${forrest.home}/lib/endorsed. You may also copy
them to the endorsed directory in your JDK installation if you wish to
use them globally for your entire system.
