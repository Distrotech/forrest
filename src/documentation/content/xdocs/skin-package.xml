Skins are standard zip archives with a *.fsj (forrest skin jar) extension, 
that can thus be also unpacked and installed automatically.
      </p>

      <p>
To publish a skin:
      </p>

<source>
1 - forrest package-skin
The skin package will be made in the skin dir, next to the custom skin.
2 - place the file in a directory on a web server
3 - ask forrest-dev to add the url and the skin name to the list of skins
</source>


      <p>
To use a custom skin with automatic download:
      </p>

<source>
1 - set the skin property in forrest.properties to the name of the skin
2 - forrest install-skin
3 - forrest
</source>

      <p>
Currently there are two test skins: "testskin" and "testskin2"
      </p>

      <p>
To see the names of the remote skins:
