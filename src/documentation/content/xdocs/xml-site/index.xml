      <section title="Welcome to the Apache XML Project">
    <p>
      The goals of the <em>Apache XML Project</em> are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        to provide commercial-quality standards-based XML solutions that are
        developed in an open and cooperative fashion,
      </li>
      <li>
        to provide feedback to standards bodies (such as IETF and W3C) from an
        implementation perspective, and
      </li>
      <li>
        to be a focus for XML-related activities within Apache projects
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <em>Apache XML Project</em> currently consists of the following sub-
      projects, each focused on a different aspect of XML:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Xerces</em> - XML parsers in Java, C++ (with Perl and COM bindings)
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Xalan</em> - XSLT stylesheet processors, in Java and C++
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Cocoon</em> - XML-based web publishing, in Java
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>AxKit</em> - XML-based web publishing, in mod_perl
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>FOP</em> - XSL formatting objects, in Java
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Forrest</em> - XML/XSLT-based developers community website foundation, using Cocoon
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Xang</em> - Rapid development of dynamic server pages, in JavaScript
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>SOAP</em> - Simple Object Access Protocol
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Batik</em> - A Java based toolkit for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Crimson</em> - A Java XML parser derived from the Sun Project X Parser.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <section title="Xerces: XML parsers in Java and C++ (plus Perl and COM)">
      <p>
        Xerces (named after the Xerces Blue butterfly) provides world-class
        XML parsing and generation. Fully-validating parsers are available for
        both Java and C++, implementing the W3C XML and DOM (Level 1 and 2)
        standards, as well as the de facto SAX (version 2) standard. The
        parsers are highly modular and configurable. Initial support for XML
        Schema (draft W3C standard) is also provided.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Perl wrapper is provided for the C++ version of Xerces, which allows
        access to a fully validating DOM XML parser from Perl. It also
        provides for full access to Unicode strings, since Unicode is a key
        part of the XML standard.
      </p>
      <p>
  A COM wrapper (also for Xerces-C) provides compatibility with the Microsoft MSXML parser.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section title="Xalan: XSL stylesheet processors in Java &amp; C++">
      <p>
  Xalan (named after a rare musical instrument) provides high-performance
  XSLT stylesheet processing. Xalan fully implements the W3C XSLT and XPath
  recommendations. The stylesheet processor is feature-rich and robust. The
  XPath Processor is useable as a stand-alone unit.  Xalan uses the Bean
  Scripting Framework (BSF) to implement Java or script extensions, features
  multiple document output extensions, and we are working on data-binding
  extensions for SQL/JDBC and other data providers.
      </p>
      <p>
  Xalan is currently available in Java, and available in Alpha form for C++.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section title="Cocoon: XML-based web publishing">
      <p>
        Cocoon is a powerful framework for XML web publishing which brings a whole
        new world of abstraction and ease to consolidated web site creation and
        management based on the XML paradigm and related technologies.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section title="AxKit: XML-based web publishing in mod_perl">
      <p>
        AxKit brings the power of XML web publishing and dynamic
        XML based applications to the Apache web server using the
        mod_perl framework and the Apache C API to combine the power
        of XML with the performance of a native Apache solution.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section title="FOP: XSL Formatting Object processor in Java">
      <p>
        FOP is the world's first print formatter driven by XSL formatting
        objects. It is a Java 1.2 application that reads a formatting object
        tree and then turns it into a PDF document. The formatting object
        tree, can be in the form of an XML document (output by an XSLT
        engine like Xalan) or can be passed in memory as a DOM Document or (in
        the case of Xalan) SAX events.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section title="Forrest: Developer Community Portal">
      <p>
        Forrest is an XML/XSLT-based, skinable documentation publishing  environment that publishes documentation and vital stats of the xml.apache.org sub-projects. It sits underneath xml.apache.org: you're looking at the result of Forrest's work.</p>
    </section>
    <section title="Xang: Rapid development of dynamic server pages in JavaScript">
      <p>
  Apache Xang lets you quickly build data-driven, cross-platform Web
  applications that integrate disparate data sources. The Xang architecture
  cleanly separates data, logic and presentation. It is based on open
  industry standards such as HTTP, XML, XSL, DOM and ECMAScript (JavaScript).
      </p>
    </section>
    <section title="SOAP: Simple Object Access Protocol">
      <p>
  The Apache Soap project is an implementation of the draft W3C
  protocol by the same name.  It is based on, and supersedes, the
  IBM SOAP4J implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the draft W3C specification:
        SOAP is a lightweight protocol for exchange of information in a
  decentralized, distributed environment. It is an XML based protocol
  that consists of three parts: an envelope that defines a framework
  for describing what is in a message and how to process it, a set of
  encoding rules for expressing instances of application-defined
  datatypes, and a convention for representing remote procedure calls
  and responses.</p>
    </section>
    <section title="Crimson: A Java XML parser derived from the Sun Project X Parser">
      <p>
      The source code for Crimson is available under the xml-crimson CVS
      module. Please visit the Crimson pages for more information.
      </p>
    </section>
