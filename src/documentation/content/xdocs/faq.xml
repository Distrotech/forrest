    <faq id="checked_out_now_what">
      <question>
        I have checked out a working copy of <code>xml-forrest</code> CVS, now what?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Run &quot;<code>./build.sh docs</code>&quot; to see the documentation
          for Forrest.
          The documentation is generated in the <code>build/site/</code> directory.
          Logfiles are in the <code>build/tmp/context/WEB-INF/logs/</code> directory.

    <faq id="validation_error:doctype_root_null">
      <question>
        When building my project, I get an validation error: <code>Document root
          element "site", must match DOCTYPE root "null".</code>.
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          You are probably trying to build the project with an old version of
          Forrest (built before 2003-01-08) that is incorrectly trying to validate
          the <code>site.xml</code> file.  If so, please update your Forrest
          installation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, you may be building with an up-to-date Forrest, but have
          overridden <code>forrest.validate.xdocs.excludes</code> in
          <code>forrest.properties</code>.  With the introduction of
          <code>site.xml</code>, the above property must have <code>site.xml</code>
          listed to prevent an attempt at DTD-based validation.

    <faq id="index.html">
      <question>
        The tab link in my site incorrectly assumes that 'index.html' is present in
        the linked-to directory. How do I fix this?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          In <code>tabs.xml</code>, use @href instead of @dir, and omit the trailing
          '/'. That will leave which file to serve up to the sitemap.  For example, if
          the 'User Manual' tab should link to <code>manual/Introduction.html</code>,
          <code>tabs.xml</code> should contain:
        </p>
        <source><![CDATA[
          <tab label="User Manual" href="manual"/>
          ]]></source>
        <p>
          and add this rule to the sitemap:
        </p>
        <source><![CDATA[
          <map:match pattern="manual">
            <map:redirect-to uri="manual/Introduction.html"/>
          </map:match>
          ]]></source>

    <faq id="own_website">
      <question>
        I gather that I will be able to use the Forrest infrastructure to build
        my own website.
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          That is correct. Many of us want to do that, and that is partially why we
          are working here. Forrest is designed to not only build websites for
          the various Apache projects, but also so that you can apply your own skins
          to your own content. Try this ...
          &quot;<code>./build.sh clean docs -Duse.skin=basic</code>&quot;
          then copy the basic skin to make your own.

    <faq id="obsolete_docs">
      <question>
        Why am I a little confused by the Forrest documentation?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Sorry, we are working on that for the next release. Forrest development has
          been very fast recently. Some of the documentation refers to old methods.
          Your best bet is to start with the
          <link href="site:your-project">Using Forrest</link> document.
