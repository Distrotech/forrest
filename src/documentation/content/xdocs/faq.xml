 <question>
  Why do the generated documents look a little strange?
 </question>
 <answer>
  <p>
   Because we are in transition to the new document-v11.dtd
   and there are still some stylesheets that need tweaking.
   See the <link href="document-v11.html">Demo document-v11</link>

 <question>
  I have checked out a working copy of <code>xml-forrest</code> CVS, now what?
 </question>
 <answer>
  <p>
   Run &quot;<code>build docs</code>&quot; to see the initial documentation
   for Forrest. A new Forrest skin is under development ...
   &quot;<code>build clean docs -Duse.skin=bert</code>&quot;

 <question>
  I gather that I will be able to use the Forrest infrastructure to build
  my own website.
 </question>
 <answer>
  <p>
   That is correct. Many of us want to do that, and that is partially why we
   are working here. Forrest will be designed to not only build websites for
   the various Apache projects, but also so that you can apply your own skins
   to your own content.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, it is not yet ready. So please help us to reach that stage.</p>
