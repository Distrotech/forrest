  <question>
    When building my project, I get an validation error: <code>Document root
      element "site", must match DOCTYPE root "null".</code>.
  </question>
  <answer>
    <p>
      You are probably trying to build the project with an old version of
      Forrest (built before 2003-01-08) that is incorrectly trying to validate
      the <code>site.xml</code> file.  If so, please update your Forrest
      installation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you may be building with an up-to-date Forrest, but have
      overridden <code>forrest.validate.xdocs.excludes</code> in
      <code>forrest.properties</code>.  With the introduction of
      <code>site.xml</code>, the above property must have <code>site.xml</code>
      listed to prevent an attempt at DTD-based validation.

 <question>
  Why do the generated documents look a little strange?
 </question>
 <answer>
  <p>
   Because we are in transition to the new document-v11.dtd
   and there are still some stylesheets that need tweaking.
   See the <link href="site:samples/document-v11">Demo document-v11</link>
   and <link href="site:compliance">Standards Compliance</link>.

 <question>
  I have checked out a working copy of <code>xml-forrest</code> CVS, now what?
 </question>
 <answer>
  <p>
   Run &quot;<code>./build.sh docs</code>&quot; to see the documentation
   for Forrest.
   The documentation is generated in the <code>build/site/</code> directory.
   Logfiles are in the <code>build/tmp/context/WEB-INF/logs/</code> directory.

 <question>
  I gather that I will be able to use the Forrest infrastructure to build
  my own website.
 </question>
 <answer>
  <p>
   That is correct. Many of us want to do that, and that is partially why we
   are working here. Forrest is designed to not only build websites for
   the various Apache projects, but also so that you can apply your own skins
   to your own content. Try this ...
   &quot;<code>./build.sh clean docs -Duse.skin=basic</code>&quot;
   then copy the basic skin to make your own.

 <question>
  Why am i a little confused by the Forrest documentation?
 </question>
 <answer>
  <p>
   Sorry, we are working on that for the next release. Forrest development has
   been very fast recently. Some of the documentation refers to old methods.
   Your best bet is to start with the
   <link href="site:your-project">Using Forrest</link> document.
