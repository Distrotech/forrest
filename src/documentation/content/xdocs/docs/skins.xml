      <p>
        Forrest supplies a collection of default skins which are configurable
        and so should meet the needs of most projects. This document explains
        those default skins.
      </p>
      <p>
        The skin names are based on playing with the word "skin". See our
        technique for
        <link href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/trunk/src/core/context/skins/new-skin-names.txt">choosing skin names</link>.

        Uses HTML tables.
      </p>
      <p>
        This skin used to be called "forrest-site" which evolved to become
        "krysalis-site".

    <section id="pelt">
      <title>pelt</title>
      <p>
        Uses CSS "div" and no HTML tables.
      </p>
      <p>
        During its development, this skin used to be called "css-style-dev".

      <title>tigris-1_1</title>
      <p>
        This skin is based on version 1.1 of the 
        <link href="http://style.tigris.org/">style.tigris.org</link> project.
        (It deliberately contravenes our skin naming convention.)
