     top-level project in
     <link href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/2004/">May 2004</link>.

          Add content, probably borrow from other projects,
          like Ant and Incubator. Define +1, 0, -1, etc.
          Define situations that require voting (e.g. technical issues,
          new committers, project direction and decisions) and whose votes
          are binding in those situations.

Mention the "Contributer License Agreement".
Who needs to send it? ... is it committers plus major contributers?
