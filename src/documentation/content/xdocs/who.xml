      <title>The Forrest Community</title>
      <p> The Forrest Project operates on a meritocracy: the more you do, the
        more responsibility you will obtain. This page lists all of the people who have
        gone the extra mile and are Committers. If you would like to get involved, the
        first step is to join the mailing lists. </p>
      <p> We ask that you please do not send us emails privately asking for
        support. We are non-paid volunteers who help out with the project and we do not
        necessarily have the time or energy to help people on an individual basis.
        Instead, we have set up mailing lists which often contain hundreds of
        individuals who will help answer detailed requests for help. The benefit of
        using mailing lists over private communication is that it is a shared resource
        where others can also learn from common mistakes and as a community we all grow
        together.</p>
