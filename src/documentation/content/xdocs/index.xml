    <section title="Introduction"> 
      <p>Forrest provides a sound technological infrastructure for open
        software development for the Apache Software Foundation based on ASF software,
        ASF practices and experience, and modern software design principles.</p> 
      <p>Our first target is to create a consistent
        <link href="http://xml.apache.org/">xml.apache.org</link> website, with a
      uniform, light-weigth and easy to navigate layout and structure. Each project
      will be responsible for maintaining its own documentation and website, which
      are imported, aggregated and published automatically by Forrest. To achieve
      this goal, we provide XML document grammars for the different types of
      documents a project's website typically consists of, and a
      <link href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/">Cocoon</link>-based site generation
      mechanism.</p>
