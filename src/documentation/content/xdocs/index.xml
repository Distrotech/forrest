      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Forrest provides a robust technological infrastructure for open
        software development for the Apache Software Foundation based on ASF software,
        ASF practices and experience, and modern software design principles.</p> 
      <p>Our first target is to create a consistent
        <link href="http://xml.apache.org/">xml.apache.org</link> website, with a
      uniform, lightweight, easy-to-navigate layout and structure. Each project
      will be responsible for maintaining its own documentation and website,
      which are imported, aggregated and published automatically by Forrest.
      The framework is intentionally designed to allow Forrest to also be
      applied in other projects.
      </p>

      <p>The Forrest framework comprises XML document grammars for the different
       types of documents that a project website typically consists of, a
       skinning facility to easily apply a different user interface, local and
       robot-based build systems to draw XML content from a repository and
       publish to local or remote sites, and a
      <link href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/">Cocoon</link>-based site
      generation mechanism.</p>
