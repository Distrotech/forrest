      <title>Run a clean target after upgrade</title>
      <p>To avoid any issue with old classes being loaded, run a
       '<code>forrest clean</code>' just after you upgraded to this version.</p>

      <title>Private skins might need changes to document2html.xsl</title>
      <p>
      Moved all references to //skinconfig out of the document2html.xsl
      into the site2xhtml.xsl file. If you have your own skins that were
      referencing "$config" or "//skinconfig" in the document2html.xsl
      then you need to make similar changes.
      For further information, see Issue
      <link href="http://issues.cocoondev.org/jira/secure/ViewIssue.jspa?key=FOR-146">FOR-146</link>.

      <title>forrest.antproxy.xml is obsolete in favor of Ant's &lt;import&gt; task</title>
      Ant projects that use <code>forrest.antproxy.xml</code> to invoke Forrest will recieve
      an error message directing them to this document.  Please see the <link href="site:your-project/invoking_from_ant">Invoking
      Forrest from Ant</link> documentation for instructions on how to use the &lt;import&gt; task.
