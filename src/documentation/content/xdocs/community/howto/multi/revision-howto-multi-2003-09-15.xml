<p>
I see that the revision2document.xsl adds a footer to suggest that the
author should be contacted to make revisions. This is not the opensource way.
This would create a bottleneck at the author. Community feedback should be
encouraged to go to the relevant listserver, and patches submitted via Bugzilla.
