      <title>Status of DTD and stylesheet development</title>
      <p>
       The structure and presentation of the How-To documents are under
       development. The following documents and the associated DTDs,
       stylesheets, and sitemap matches, are under constant change.
       The content of these documents is just sample content and may not
       even apply to Forrest. Over time, these samples will change so that
       they are applicable to any project.
      </p>

      <p>
       We are also conducting an experiment with feedback integration.
       Go to the bottom of the Multi-page sample to see the revisions which
       are automatically appended by the sitemap during 'build docs'.
       Any snippet document with the filename
       <code>revision-howto-xmlform-YYYY-MM-DD.xml</code> is appended to the
       main page.

These are demonstration documents to help with the current development work
on the howto-v10 DTD and stylesheets. Please help to correct any deficiency.

      <title>Real How-Tos</title> 
<p>
Even though the howto-v10 DTD is not yet stable, some important How-To
documents are being developed now. Over time this community/howto/ area will
grow and the samples will go away.
