<h1>Forrestbot's Dodgy Web Interface</h1>
<p>
This site contains automatically updated and built versions of websites built
with the latest <a href="http://xml.apache.org/forrest/">Forrest</a>. It aims
to provide a service similar to <a
  href="http://jakarta.apache.org/gump/">Gump</a>, but for websites.  Host
projects' XML is automatically checked out and the HTML rebuilt every hour.
</p>
<p>
In addition, if you have just made a site update and are itching to see the
result, site refreshes can be triggered manually.
</p>
<p>
In future (pending lots more security) designated users will be able to commit
the regenerated HTML to Apache's <b>xml-site</b> module. Right now this only
works for the xml-forrest module.
</p>
<p>
To manually refresh a site or trigger an update requires a username/password,
available on request.
</p>
