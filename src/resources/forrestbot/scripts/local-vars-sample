# This is a template local-vars-* file.
# Copy it to local-vars-`uname -n` and customize.
# If you run the script and webapp from the default
# xml-forrest/src/resources/forrestbot/scripts/ directory, the default values
# should be fine, and only XML_SITE needs to be defined.


# BASE is a pointer to the 'scripts' directory from Forrest. It defaults to
# '.', and should be set to an absolute path if called from cron
BASE=/usr/serverlocal/forrestbot/scripts

# Points to a CVS checkout of the xml-forrest module, which will be
# (optionally) 'cvs update'ed and rebuilt on every run.  Defaults to
# $BASE/../../../../ ie, assuming the user is in
# xml-forrest/src/resources/forrestbot/scripts/
FORREST=/usr/serverlocal/src/apache/xml-forrest

# Assuming the overseer command is being fed instructions from the webapp, this
# variable points to the webapp context root.  Defaults to $BASE/../webapp
WEBAPP=/www/forrestbot.cocoondev.org/webapps/ROOT

# If you want the 'publish_livesite' command to work, you must set XML_SITE to
# point to a CVS checkout of the xml-site module.
XML_SITE=/home/j/jeffturner/xml-site

# Max number of seconds we expect a full forrestbot run to take, before we
# assume something's hung and kill the processes.  Defaults to 20 minutes.
TIMEOUT=$[10*60]

# Set this to true if you want to delete any local mods to the $FORREST and
# update from CVS.  Not recommended unless scripts/ is moved outside the
# xml-forrest CVS hierarchy. Defaults to false
REGEN_FORREST=false

# In a headless environment like your typical Unix box (not running X), you
# should install Xvfb, and set this DISPLAY variable appropriately. No default.
# The value ':0' is correct if Xvfb is invoked with:
# /usr/X11R6/bin/Xvfb :0 -screen 0 2048x2048x24
export DISPLAY=:0

# If you run the script from cron, you should set generic env vars like
# JAVA_HOME here:
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/jdk1.3.1_03
