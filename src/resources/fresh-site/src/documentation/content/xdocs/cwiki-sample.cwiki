!Example heading
  
!!bold and italics stuff
Here's some __bold text__ and now "some italic text I hope ". Not

!!bullets
* first bulleted item
* second bulleted item

!!numbered lists
# number list point 1
## is that 1.1?
### is that 1.1.1?
# this is point 2
# and point 3

We _love_ horizontal rules [1]
