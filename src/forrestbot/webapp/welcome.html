<h1>Forrestbot's Dodgy Web Interface</h1>
<p>
This site contains automatically updated and built versions of websites built
with the latest <a href="http://xml.apache.org/forrest/">Forrest</a>. It aims
to provide a service similar to <a
  href="http://jakarta.apache.org/gump/">Gump</a>, but for websites.  Host
projects' XML is automatically checked out and the HTML rebuilt every 4 hours.
</p>
<p>
In addition, if you have just made a site update and are itching to see the
result, site refreshes can be triggered manually.
</p>
<p>
Certain users can also trigger an automatic publish of the generated HTML/PDFs
to Apache's site CVS module (xml-site, avalon-site, etc).
</p>
<p>
To request a username/password that allows you to refresh and/or publish your
project's site, please mail <a href="mailto:jefft.at.apache.org">Jeff
  Turner</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you have any questions, please mail <a
  href="mailto:jefft.at.apache.org">Jeff Turner</a>, or <a
