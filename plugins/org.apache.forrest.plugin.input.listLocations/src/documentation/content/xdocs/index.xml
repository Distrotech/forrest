      <title>listLocations Plugin</title>
      <p>
        This plugin uses lists of locations maintained in a simple xml format
        and transforms them to documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Either add the document type declaration to the xml instance (Forrest will
        automatically respond to it), or use URIs of the form *locations.html
        (i.e. any URI ending with "locations.html"). See Samples.
      </p>
      <p>The following input produces <a href="site:locations">this output</a>.</p>
