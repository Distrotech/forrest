      <p>
        Produces properties from an input-module. This is been managed by the
        heart of this plugin the ModuleGenerator. The generator is contacting
        the input module and gets an iterator of all attributes names. This
        iterator will be then used to receive the values of the key. Till now we
        only use a Object to String cast but an input module does not have to
        return a simple String but can return any object. This may cause
        ClassCastExceptions for the values.

      <ul>
        <li><a href="module.properties.properties">Properties of the project input 
          module</a> - used in the sitemap like 
          {properties:content.xdocs}</li>
        <li><a href="module.date.properties">Properties of the date input 
          module</a> - we cast an object to a string, but the module returns 
          java.util.Date. This causes a ClassCastException.</li>
      </ul>
