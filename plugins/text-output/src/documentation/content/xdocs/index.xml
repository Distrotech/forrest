      <p>This plugin allows Forrest files to be output as simple text.</p>

      <title>How to Use the Text Plugin</title>

      <p>The plugin needs to be incorporated into your existing build of
      Forrest. To do this,</p>

      <ol>
        <li><code>cd $FORREST_HOME/plugin/</code></li>

        <li><code>../main/build.sh local-deploy</code></li>

        <li>At this point, you'll be asked the name of the plugin to deploy.
        The name of this plugin is <strong>text-output</strong></li>
      </ol>

      <p>Once you have the text plugin installed, it is simply a case of
      requesting a file with an txt extension. For example, <a
      href="index.txt">this page as text</a>.</p>
