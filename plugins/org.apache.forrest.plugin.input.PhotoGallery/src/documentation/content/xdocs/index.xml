      <title>input.PhotoGallery Plugin</title>
      <p>This plugin creates photo albums from sets of photographs.</p>
      
      <p>The pictures are expected under 
      <code>{project:content.xdocs}/images/gallery/**</code>.  To create your photo 
      albums simply create a new directory for each photo album under the gallery 
      directory. Place your original sized pictures into each gallery sub-directory. The thumbnail and small sized images will be automatically generated from these.</p>

      <p>Then place a simple album description file named album.xml in each
      directory.  Look in the sample gallery for an example of this album.xml file.
      A request for gallery/index.html then provides a list of
      <a href="site:gallery-list">available galleries</a>
      together with their titles and descriptions.
      </p>
      
      <p>To view a screen of thumbnails, you need to request an URL in the form of 
      <code>gallery/**/index.html</code>. By default 20 pictures will be 
      displayed. If you have more than 20 then you will need to use an URL in
      the form of <code>gallery/**/index_X.html</code> (where X is the page 
      number you want to view). 
      See our <a href="gallery/demo/index_1.html">demo index</a> for an example.</p>
      
      <p>To view a single picture at a size optimised for the delivery mechanism, you 
      need to request an URL in the form of <code>gallery/**/pic_PICTURE_NUMBER.html</code>,
      where PICTURE_NUMBER is the number of the picture you want to display.
      See our <a href="gallery/demo/pic_1.html">demo one picture</a>,
      <a href="gallery/demo/pic_2.html">demo two picture</a>, 
      <a href="gallery/demo/pic_3.html">demo three picture</a> for examples.</p>
      
      <p>To view a single picture at its natural size, you need to request an 
      URL in the form of <code>gallery/**/fullPic_PICTURE_NUMBER.html</code>.
      See our <a href="gallery/demo/fullPic_1.html">demo one picture</a>,
      <a href="gallery/demo/fullPic_2.html">demo two picture</a>, 
      <a href="gallery/demo/fullPic_3.html">demo three picture</a> for examples.</p>
