      <notes>
        <p>This plugin encapsulates and extends functionality that was originally in
        Forrest Core. With the advent of plugins in Forrest 0.7 we extracted the
        functionlaity for generating changes.xml and todo.xml from status.xml. It is 
        intended that this functionlaity be extended further within this plugin.</p>
        
        <p>In fact, we have already extended the functionaliy in a couple of important
        ways. See the changelog for more details.</p>
