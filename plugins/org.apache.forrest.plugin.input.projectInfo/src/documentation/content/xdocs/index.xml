      <title>Producing Release Notes</title>
      <p>To produce release notes you must maintain a <code>status.xml</code> file
      for your project and request a page with an URL such as 
      <code>http://domain.com/releaseNotes_0.7-dev.html</code>, this will be produce
      the release notes for 0.7-dev.</p>
      
      <p>If the version number ends with <code>-dev</code> a warning will be included 
      in the generated page, informing the reader that it is a development version and
      therefore the list of changes is incomplete.</p>

      <p>For a <code>status.xml</code> <code>action</code> toi be included in the 
      release notes it must have an attribute <code>importance="high"</code>. When
      writing actions in <code>status.xml</code> you should write them with the
      following two questions in mind:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>should it be importance="high"?</li>
        <li>will the action read correctly in the release notes?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The introductory text in the release notes comes from the (optional) 
      element <code>notes</code> (a child of the <code>release</code> element).</p>
