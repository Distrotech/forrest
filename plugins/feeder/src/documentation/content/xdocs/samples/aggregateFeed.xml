    <p>This sample shows how a number of different feeds can be aggregated
    into a single feed and then displayed in a Forrest site. In order to do 
    this you must first create an aggregate descriptor file and then 
    create a link in the following format:</p>
      
    <source>
&lt;a href="/feederAggregate/path/aggregateDescriptor.typeExtension"&gt;Feed Link Text&lt;/a&gt;
    </source>

      <title>Aggregate Descriptor File</title>
      <p>The aggregate descriptor file is an XML doucment that describes the
      feeds that you want to collate into a single document. It has the 
      following format:</p>
      
      <source><![CDATA[
<aggregateDescriptor>
<feed id="planetApache">
  <url>http://www.planetapache.org/rss20.xml</url>
</feed>
<feed id="planetJava">
  <url>http://planetjava.org/rss.php</url>
</feed>
</aggregateDescriptor>
]]></source>
  
      <p><a href="/feederAggregate/samples/aggregate/demoAggregation.xml">Take a 
      look</a> at what the above file produces.</p>
