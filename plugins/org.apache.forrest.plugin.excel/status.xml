      <action type="add" context="xsl" dev="RDG" due-to="Johannes Schaefer" fixes-bug="FOR-432">
        New feature: 'text' in first column to create descriptive text.
      </action>
      <action type="fix" context="caption" dev="RDG" due-to="Johannes Schaefer" fixes-bug="FOR-432">
        Minor issue: captions are now included even if Excel skips
        cell at position three and writes weird "ss:Index=4".
      </action>
      <action dev="RDG" type="fix" due-to="Johannes Schaefer" fixes-bug="FOR-432">
        Fixed bug: input.xmap pointed to the project's resources dir
        not the plugin's. So, plugin documentation worked fine, but
        any other project didn't.
      </action>
      <action dev="RDG" type="add" context="admin" due-to="Johannes Schaefer" fixes-bug="FOR-373">
        Initial plugin code.
