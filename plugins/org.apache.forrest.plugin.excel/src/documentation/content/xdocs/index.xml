      <title>Summary</title>
      <p>
        With the Excel table input plugin it is possible to create
        forrest tables directly from Excel XML output.  Excel sheets
        will be translated into sections, and each sheet will generate
        a table.  Only simple tables are supported (by now).
        Formatting is not transferred to forrest but some
        calculations are.
