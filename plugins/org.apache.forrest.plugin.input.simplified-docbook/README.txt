org.apache.forrest.plugin.input.simplified-docbook Plugin
=========================

This plugin supports a Simplified Docbook. Although it does not support the
full docbook vocabulary it does allow output in all supported Forrest formats.

You may want to look at the docbook-full plugin which supports the full
Docbook vocabulary, but has some limitations with respect to its integration
into Forrest.
