  <title>How to create your own implementation </title>

generate XHTML content for the tabs to make it "most amenable" to CSS
skinning. Personally, I would just output each tab in its own div
element, with class attributes denoting the selected tab. One can then
use CSS to structure/color them appropriately."</p>
<note>All following explanations/steps assume you use the default
configuration of forrest.</note>
	<p>Ok, you may want to try another feature that is coming with
forrest:views.</p>

	<title>Create your own contract implementation</title>
		<ol>
		<li>Create in src/documentation the folder resources/templates. ...or
more generally speaking create ${project.resources-dir}/templates.</li>
		<li>Copy
{this.plugins.path}/resources/templates/nav-main.ft to this folder.
</li>
		<li>Add after the <![CDATA[<xsl:template name="nav-main-body"/>]]> something like 
</li>
		<source><![CDATA[<xsl:template match="ul[@id='nav-main']">
<div id="nav-main">
  <xsl:apply-templates select="li"/>
</div>
</xsl:template>
<xsl:template match="li[not(@class)]">
<div class="base-not-selected">
  <xsl:apply-templates/>
</div>
</xsl:template>
<xsl:template match="li[@class='current']">
<div class="current">
  <xsl:apply-templates/>
</div>
</xsl:template>]]></source>
<li>Change the css in <![CDATA[<xsl:template name="nav-main-css">]]>. I tried but
the result is not nice. If you succeed please change the name of the
contract to "nav-main-div", add the patch to the issue-tracker and I add
the new contract to the viewHelper plugin. ;-)</li>
