  <title>ViewHelper </title>
<p>Each forrest:contract of a forrest:view will dispatch a xml file (ViewHelper) that contains
xsl:stylesheets for the different output formats, a contract can
implement. For html, the only format that we have implemented so far, we
have three different kind of templates:</p><p>
<![CDATA[<xsl:templates name="{contract/@name}-css/>]]><br/>
Here the contract specific css will be stored.
</p><p>
<![CDATA[<xsl:templates name="{contract/@name}-head/>]]><br/>
Here goes everything that belongs in the html head. e.g. scripts.
</p><p>
<![CDATA[<xsl:templates name="{contract/@name}-body/>]]><br/>
Everything that belongs into the body.
  </p>
  <p>You can find sample implementations in {this.plugins.path}/resources/templates/.</p>
