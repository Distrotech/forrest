      <title>Supported Simplified Docbook Versions</title>
      <warning>SDocbook support is not yet considered complete. However, it 
      is certainly usable. If you find an element is not supported please
      raise an issue on the project issue tracker.</warning>
      <p>The following versions of SDocbook are supported. Other versions
      can be added, please raise an issue if you need additional 
      support.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>-//OASIS//DTD Simplified DocBook XML V1.0//EN</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This plugin can also be used to render full docbook files. However,
      it is not intended for this purpose and results may vary. Supported DTD's
      are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.1.2//EN</li>
        <li>-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.2//EN</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Support for other versions of Docbook can be added easily. Ask us on
      the user list.</p>
