    <title>Feeder Plugin - Aggregate Feed example</title>
  </header>
  <body>
    <p>
      This sample shows how a number of different feeds can be aggregated into a
      single feed and then displayed in a Forrest site. Creating an aggregated
      feed is no different to embedding a <a href="singleFeed.xml">single
      feed</a>. Simply add more feeds into your feed descriptor file and then
      link to it in the same way.

<![CDATA[
<feedDescriptor>
  <feed id="BBCSport_UK">
    <url>http://news.bbc.co.uk/rss/sportonline_uk_edition/front_page/rss.xml</url>
  </feed>
  <feed id="USAToday_Sports">
    <url>http://www.usatoday.com/repurposing/SportsRss.xml</url>
  </feed>
