        Changed the way we identify feeds, now embedded in a feedDescritpor 
        file. This file can later be used to control the rendering of the feed,
        for example, limit the number of items displayed, add a disclaimer etc.

        Creating a PDF can be problematic with some feeds. The content of the 
        feed is placed into a fo:block in an unprocessed form. As a result
        there is HTML in the block. This seems to confuse FOP as it produces
        org.apache.fop.apps.FOPException: internal-destination or external-destination must be specified in basic-link
