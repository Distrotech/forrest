        Creating a PDF can be problematic with some feeds. The content of the 
        feed is placed into a fo:block in an unprocessed form. As a result
        there is HTML in the block. This seems to confuse FOP as it produces
        org.apache.fop.apps.FOPException: internal-destination or external-destination must be specified in basic-link
