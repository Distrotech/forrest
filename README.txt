What is Apache Forrest
----------------------
Apache Forrest is a standards-based documentation framework
which uses Apache Cocoon. Forrest emphasises separation of
presentation and content, using a plugin architecture to
transform and aggregate various input sources into various
output formats. This creates a unified document collection
that can either be used as a dynamic application, or generated
at the command-line, or generated and deployed with an automated
publishing application.

Requirements
------------
Forrest is implemented both as a Java servlet and a Java command line
application. The following requirements exist for installing it:

  * A Java 1.4 or later compatible virtual machine for your operating system.
