            <title>Overview</title>
            <p>
                A recurring need for Forrest users is the ability to
                manage multiple sites within a single forrest project.
                This is an experiment to make it work.
            </p>

                    Summary of a discussion
                </a>
                many of the Forrest devs had at ApacheCon quite some
                time ago. Note that this discussion was pre dispatcher
                days, but the basic ideas are still relevant.

            <title>Design</title>

            <p>
                This design is back of envelope. I'm hoping lots of
                others will find the time to look it over and comment.
            </p>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Forrest Project</dt>
                    <dd>
                        is the controlling project it contains the
                        "master" content. It also contains the
                        configuration information that pulls everything
                        together (i.e. contains one or more content
                        objects) and is where we run the "forrest *"
                        commands to make things happen. The Forrest
                        Project is sometimes referred to as the master
                        project.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Content Object</dt>
                    <dd>
                        this is a section of content in the Forrest
                        Project. It is itself a forrest project (i.e.
                        can contain other content objects). As a Forrest
                        Project it can be built independently or as a
                        content object embedded within another Forrest
                        Project. Content objects, when embedded in
                        another Forrest project is sometimes referred to
                        as a sub project.

            <section>
                <title>Expected Problems</title>

                <p>
                    The core Forrest sitemaps are almost certainly
                    insufficient to process sub sites.
                </p>

        <section>
            <title>Testing</title>

            <p>
                Since llamar has a use case we will implement this on a
                simple seed set and llamar can test it on a more complex
                implementation locally.
            </p>

            <p>
                The test site will consist of a seed-basic site as the
                forrest project, a standard seed site as the first sub
                project and a standard seed-business site as the second
                sub project. The URL space will be:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>/ - master project (your looking at it now)</li>
                <li>/seed - seed project</li>
                <li>
                    /secondSeed - a second seed project, but with a
                    different theme
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                I have created the various seed sites in
                whiteboard/multipleSites/[master|subsite-seed|subsite-secondSeed]

              <p>This list of URLs demonstrates and tests the features of the
              multple sites version of Forrest.</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li><a href="seed/index.html">Seed index</a> - the index page for the sirst subsite</li>

        <section>
            <title>Implementation</title>

            <p>Like all good open source software development we'll go with an incremental
            development style. Lets just get it working and then pretty it up later. This section
            describes the current implementation and records things we think we ought to do in the
            future. At some point the "things to do" section will move into the issue tracker, but
            at this early stage of experimentation here is just fine.</p>

            <section>
              <title>Mounting Subsites</title>
              
              <p>The locationmap allows us to locate content from subsite content objects.
              So we need to add entries to the locationmap will extend the locations searched 
              for content. Add the following to the master projects locationmap.</p>
              
              <source><![CDATA[
<match pattern="project.seed/**">
    <location src="{properties:subsite.xdocs.seed}/{1}" />
</match>
              ]]></source>
              
              <p>Note that this snippet uses a new property. This is defined in the 
              <code>forrest.properties.xml</code> file like this:</p>
              
              <source><![CDATA[
<property name="subsite.xdocs.seed" value="C:\projects\forrest\whiteboard\multipleSites\subsite-seed\src\documentation\content\xdocs"/>
              ]]></source>
              
              <p>Obviously you need to make this value reflect your setup.</p>
              
              <fixme author="rdg">We can't have absolute locations to the content like this.</fixme>
              
                <section>
                  <title>Potential Improvements</title>
                  
                  <p>Create a a <code>siteplan.xml</code> document that describes
                  in a less verbose way which content objects should be included
                  in this master project and where they are to be found. This can
                  then be used to generate the relevant locationmap
                  files.</p>
                  
                  <p>The use of relative locations in the locationmap means that content 
                  objects are not easily moved about.</p>
                  
                  <p>some kind of lookup mechanism for content objects would allow us to move
                  content objects around without breaking master projects. Perhaps the
                  plugin mechanism would work here. That is a content object is a new kind of
                  plugin.</p>
