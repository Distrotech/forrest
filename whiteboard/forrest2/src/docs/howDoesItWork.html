<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Forrest uses three major components in its processing:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Readers - read source documents</li>
  <li>Input Plugins - converts source documents to 
  the internal Forrest format</li>
  <li>Output Plugins - converts internal format documents to
  the requried output format</li>
</ol>

<p>Different implementations of each of these components
allow different processing to take place. For example,
different readers will retrieve the source document using
different methods, such as HTTP, FTP or SSH. Different 
input plugins will allow different types of source document
to be processed and different output plugins will provide
different output formats such as HTML, PDF or OpenOffice.org</p>

<p>In the followin sections we will examine how the Forrest
controller selets which reader, input and ouput plugins to use
for any particular request.</p>

<h2>Selecting Readers</h2>

<p>Which reader is used to read a source document is defined
by the protocol used in the location URL. Note that this
has nothing to do with the request URL, it is defined in
the locationmap for the Forrest content object. So, for example,
if the source location of a file is defined as 
<span class="source">file://foo/bar.html</span> the reader
defined to handle "file:" requests will be used.</p>

<p>To define a reader for a specific protocol we add a bean 
definition to our content objects forestContext.xml file. 
The ID of the bean should be the name of the protocol we wish
process with this reader. For example:</p>

<p class="source"><![CDATA[
  	<bean id="file" class="org.apache.forrest.reader.FileReader"></bean>
]]></p>

<h3>What Source Type?</h3>

<p>A reader creates a source document object that is used in
the next stage of processing. This source document is an object
that extends <span class="source">AbstractSourceDocument</span>.
A method <span class="source">getType</span> returns a string
identifying the type of document represented. This string is
used in the next stage of processing, which is selecting an
Input plugin to convert the source document to our internal
format.</p>

<p>A <span class="source">DocumnetFactory</span> is provided
by core that attempts to identify the source document type.
This factory is used by the default readers provided by core.
However, in some cases, such as when an XML document does not
provide a DTD definition that can be used to identify the
document type, you will need to create a custom reader that
returns the correct document type. In this case the utility
class <span class="source">DefaultSourceDocument</span> 
will probably be useful (see the 
<span class="source">setType</span> method).</p>

<h2>Selecting Input Plugins</h2>

<p>Each input plugin will process a single type of source 
document. Each document is defined by a "type", this is 
set by the reader that reads the document. In many cases
this will be a MIME type, but where no suitably specific
MIME type exists, such as an XML document, an arbitrary 
string can be used.</p>

<p>When selecting an input plugin to be used the documents
type is utilised to lookup the correct input plugin. To 
facilitate this lookup we again use the ID of the input
plugins bean as defined in the forrestContext.xml file. For
example, the following will process documents of type bar:</p>

<p class="source"><![CDATA[
	<bean id="bar" class="bar.Foo"/>
]]></p>

<h2>Selecting an Output Plugin</h2>

<p>An output plugin is selected by looking at the request URL
of the. This URL is matched against an output plugin by looking
at an "pattern" property in the bean that implements the plugin.
The first bean that is found where the request URL matches the
supplied pattern will be used to process the output. 
In addition to the pattern property an output plugin 
specifies an XSLT file that is used to convert the internal 
format to our desired output format.</p>

<p>For example, the following output plugin will be used
to proces requests ending in either ".html" or ".htm".</p>

<p class="source"><![CDATA[
	<bean id="html"
		class="org.apache.forrest.core.plugin.XSLTOutputPlugin">
		<property name="pattern" value=".*\.html|.*\.htm" />
		<property name="xsltPath"
			value="/xdocs/samples/xslt/internal-to-html.xsl" />
	</bean>
]]></p>
