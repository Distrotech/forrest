<title>Welcome to Forrest 2</title>
</head>
<body>
<div class="note">
<p>This document is written as though this is approved as a Forrest
2 implementation, however, it is important to note that this is only an
experiment at this time. The Apache Forrest project is using this
implementation as a discussion tool. This code should therefore be
considered as PRE-ALPHA and should not be used for anything other than
experimentation.</p>
</div>

<h1>Forrest 2.0</h1>

<p>Forrest2 is a complete rewrite of the XML publishing framework
Apache Forrest.</p>

<p>It draws on the lessons learned during development and use of
earlier verions of Forrest, but it takes the opportunity to simplify the
implementation and use wherever possible.</p>

<p>Forrest2 is no longer built upon Apache Cocoon, it is a plain
Java application.</p>

<p>This may prompt you to ask "does this mean we lose the power of
the Apache Cocoon framework?" The answer to that question is an emphatic
no. You see, Apache Cocoon can still be used by Forrest, but you are no
longer tied to it as was the case with earlier versions.</p>

<p>Breaking away from Cocoon means that embedding Forrest2 in
another application is much easier. In fact, since the new Forrest can
be packaged as a Cocoon generator it is, ironically enough, easier to
use in another Cocoon application than the original Forrest was. At the
same time it is easier to embed Forrest in any other type of
application.</p>

<p>The core of Forrest2 is only a few megabytes in size (and can
doubtless be trimmed even further). This compares very favourably with
40Mb+ for Cocoon based versions of Forrest.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the removal of Cocoon as the core framework means
that extending Forrest no longer requires an understanding of Cocoon, in
fact, Forrest2 can be extended very easily with just about any
technology (including Cocoon). It is now possible to extend Forrest in
any way you desire, all you need to do is expose your services via a
REST style API.</p>

<p>Of course, it's easier to use too...</p>

<h1>Using Forrest 2.0</h1>

<h2>Background Concepts</h2>

<p>Forrest 2.0 builds on the concept of input and output plugins
that were introduced in Forrest 0.7. An input plugin processes a source
document and coverts it to an internal format for use within Forrest.
This internal format is a subset of XHTML2. The internal document is
further processed by zero or more output plugins which provide further
processing to create the final output documents, in whatever format is
required.</p>

<p>Forrest 2.0 also utilises the Locationmap, utilised extensively
in Forrest 0.8. This is a configuration file that maps request URL's to
source documents. Thus allowing the client URL space to be completely
decoupled from the surce URI space.</p>

<h2>Hello World Example</h2>

<div class="note"><p>Code for all examples in this document can be found in the src/examples
directory of the core distribution.</p></div>

<p>As is traditional we will work from the simplest possible use case and build up the
complexity as we explore Forrest 2.0 in use. Of course, we will start with the most
simplistic "Hello World" example we can.</p>

<p>This simple case means we provide a "Hello World" document in a subset of XHTML2,
i.e. it will already be in a format suitable for use within Forrest. We will
require an output of this document in XHTML2.</p>

<p>Hmmm... that sounds pretty pointless, what will Forrest actually do in this use 
case?</p>

<p>This use case will illustrate the decoupling of the client URL space from the
source URI space. In so doing it will show how to configure a basic instance
of Forrest 2.0.</p>

<p>So, we want to alow the user to request the document "helloWorld.xhtml2" and recieve
and XHTML2 document generated from a source document located at
"src/xdocs/helloWorld.xhtml2".</p>

<h3>Source Document</h3>

<p>There is nothing magical about the source document. It's a simple XHMTL2 document:</p>

<div class="code"><![CDATA[
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/css" 
                 href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/style/xhtml2.css"?>


<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2002/06/xhtml2" xml:lang="en"
	xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.w3.org/2002/06/xhtml2/ http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/SCHEMA/xhtml2.xsd">
<head>
<title>XHTML 2 Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
<h>
Hello World
</h>
</body>
</html>
]]>
</div>

<p>This document is stored in "src/xdocs/helloWorld.xhtml2"</p>

<h3>Locationmap</h3>

<p>The locationmap, in its simplest form, is used to map the
client URI to the actual location of the source document. In this case
we need the following locationmap:</p>

<div class="code"><[![CDATA
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<locationmap>
<location pattern="helloWorld.xhtml2">
<source href="classpath:/xdocs/helloWorld.xhtml2" />
</location>
</locationmap>
]]></div>

<p>Note the use of the "classpath:" protocol. This means that Forrest will
search the classpath for the resource. Valid protocols in Forrest core
are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>file:</li>
  <li>http:</li>
  <li>lasspath:</li>
</ul>

<p>These protocols can be extended by
adding additional readers, we'll discuss this later.</p>

<p>The locationmap
document is stored in "src/locationmap.xml"</p>

<h3>Running Forrest</h3>

<p>There are a number of ways of running Forrest. Perhaps
the most convenient is the Forrest webapp. This is not a part of core
though, so we will focus on the command line version for now.</p>

<p>The class
org.apache.forrest.cli.CLI implements the command line. The simplest way
of running the command line is with:</p>

<div class="code">
java -jar forrest.jar org.apache.forrest.cli.CLI [REQUEST_URI]
</div>

<p>So, in this instance we would
run the following command from within the src/examples/helloWorld
directory:</p>

<div class="code">
java -jar [FORREST_HOME]/forrest.jar org.apache.forrest.cli.CLI hellowWorld.xhtml2
</div>

<p>This command dumps
the results document to System.out, so you will see the source document
displayed on the screen.</p>

<p>In this example forrest does not do any
internal processing because we request an XHTML2 document. In the next
example we'll look at how we can get Forrest to do some output
processing for us.</p>

<h2>HTML Hello World Example</h2>

<p>In
this example we will use the same XHTML2 input document, but we want to
retrieve an HTML version of that document for display in a standard
browser. To achieve this we will have Forrest process the document using
an HTML output plugin. This output plugin will convert the XHTML2
internal document into an HTML document.</p>

<p>Forrest 2.0 core includes an
output plugin that will convert from the internal XHTML2 format to HTML.
This is the only output plugin bundled with Forrest2 core. We need to ensure 
Forrest uses this plugin for this example. To do this
all we need to do is add a new entry to our locationmap and request the file
"helloWorld.html" (note the changed extension).</p>

<h3>Locationmap</h3>

<p>Recall that the locationmap maps request URLs to source files. In our
first example we added a mapping from "helloWorld.xhtml2" to
"classpath:/xdocs/helloWorld.xhtml2". In this example we will
be requesting "helloWorld.html", so we need a new mapping. Add the following to
your locationmap:</p>

<div class="code"><![CDATA[
<location pattern="helloWorld.html">
<source href="classpath:/xdocs/helloWorld.xhtml2" />
</location>
]]></div>

<p>This will work just fine, but we now have two mappings that use the 
helloWorld.xhtml2 source file. Surely there is a way to express these two 
matches in a more concise way.</p>

<div class="todo">Explain that we could use pattern="helloWorld.*" for both cases
since the source file is the same . The pattern is a regular expression.</div>

<p>That's it, there is no need to tell Forrest that it must process a request for
helloWorld.html with the HTML output plugin since, by default, the plugin will
be activated for any request ending in ".html". Since it is a goal of Forrest 
to remove the need to predefine
the client URL space you will not be suprised to learn that it is not
necessary to use an ".html" extension to trigger the html output plugin.
It is possible to configure the trigger as any part of a request URL,
for example, we may use something like "/html/helloWorld". Discussion of
how to configure this is outside the scope of this example.</p>


<h2>Embedding Forrest</h2>

<p>The main driver
behind writing Forrest 2.0 was to make it more embeddable. Earlier
versions of Forrest were built on top of Cocoon and therefore it
was difficult and/or computationally expensive to embed forrest in anything that
was not based on Cocoon. Forrest 2.0 Core provides two main techniques for
embedding. First, you can use the CLI to pipe results to other
applications in your command shell. Secondly, Forrest 2.0 exposes a
simple Java API that allows it to be controlled programatically.</p>

<p>If
neither of these solutions suits your use case, for example, you are not
using Java and do not want to rely on shell scripts, then there is a
separate web application that exposes Forrest via a REST style interface.</p>

<p>Of course, it would be perfectly possible to create other extensions
that enable Forrest to be embedded in other ways, such via a SOAP
interface.</p>

<h3>Embedding using the CLI</h3>

<div class="todo">simple example of piping results to another
shell command Java</div>

<h3>Embedding using the Java API</h3>

<p>All you need to do to embed Forrest using he Java API is
instantiate an instance of the Forrest Controller class, then you 
request the document required. For example:</p> 

<div class="code"><pre>
Controller controller = new Controller();
AbstractOutputDocument doc = controller.getOutputDocument(requestURI);
</pre></div>

<p>That's it! At least it is for most use cases.</p>

<p>As a more complete example lets look at the 
core of a simple CLI class (with exception handling removed for
clarity):</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
public static void main(String[] args) { 
  try { 
    URI requestURI = new URI(args[0]);
    Controller controller = new Controller();
    AbstractOutputDocument doc;
    doc = controller.getOutputDocument(requestURI);
    System.out.println(doc.getContentAsString());
  } catch (...) { 
    ... 
  } }
</pre></div>

<p>As another example, here is the doGet method of a servlet that will route requests to
Forrest and stream the results back to the requesting client.</p>

<div class="todo"> show the webapp servlet class.</div>

<h2>Running Forrest 2.0 as a Webapp</h2>

<div class="todo">HTML Hello World example run in
the webapp.</div> 

<h2>Extending Forrest</h2>

<p>There are three key ways to extend Forrest:</p>

<ul>
  <li>readers - read source documents</li>
  <li>input plugins - convert source documents to internal documents</li>
  <li>output plugins - convert internal documents to output documents</li>
</ul>

<p>To give you an idea of
what you can do with each of these lets consider a few hypothetical
examples of each type of extension.</p>

<h3>Readers</h3>

<p>Readers add
protocols to the locationmap, thus allowing different methods of reading
source documents. For example, we may build a relational database reader.</p>

<p>This reader reads a document from a
relational database and provide it in an XML format. It adds a
locationmap protocol of "db:" and is configured from within the URL, e.g.
"db:user@dbserver.domain.co.uk/catalogue:product.id=AL292"</p>

<p>The above URL will return an XML representation of the product with ID
"AL292" from the database "catalogue" on the server at "dbserver.domain.co.uk".
The database is accessed using the username "user".</p>

<h3>Input Plugins</h3>

<p>Input plugins take some kind of input document and convert
them to an XHTML2 internal document for further processing. For example 
we could have an input plugin that converts OpenOffice.org documents
to Forrest documents.</p>


<h3>Output Plugins</h3>

<p>Output Plugins convert an internal document into
the final output format that is required. For example a PDF Output Plugin
converts an internal document into a PDF document.</p>

<h2>Configuring Forrest</h2>

<p>Forrest uses the Spring
framework to manage its configuration. If you need to add one or more
readers or plugins to Forrest core you need to create a Spring context
file in your project. This will be stored at 
"PROJECT_HOME/src/forrestContext.xml".</p>

<h1>Extended Examples</h1>

<p>This set of examples extend the
reading, input and output capabilites of Forrest to perform more complex
tasks than are capable with Forrest Core. They therefore demonstrate the use
of additional readers and plugins.</p>

<h2>HTML From Plain Text Hello World</h2>

<p>This example illustrates the use
of an input plugin.</p>

<div class="todo">an example showing the creation of an HTML
document from a plain text source document.</div>

<h2>PDF From Plain Text Hello World</h2>

<p>This example illustrates the use
of an output plugin in conjunction with the input plugin from the previous
example.</p>

<p>an example showing the creation of an PDF
document from a plain text source document.</p>

<h3>Hello Username</h3>

<p>This example illustates the use of a reader to extract
information about the execution environment.</p>

<h3>Affiliates Product Catalogue</h3>

<p>In <a href="example/affiliateProductDatabase.html">this example</a>
we create an input plugin to use
product feeds from affiliate programs (in this case
TradeDoubler). This is then coupled with an output plugin
that presents this data as an HTML page for inclusion in
a web site or as a PDF document for printing.</p>

<h3>Extended Product Catalogue</h3>

<p class="todo">In this example, we extend the affiliate
product catalogue example by adding business logic to the
reader. In the previous version all products in the feed
appeared in the catalogue. In this new version we are able
to provide keywords that must be present in the product
title or description for it to appear in the catalogue.</p>

<p>This example illustrates how an Input plugin can extend
the functioanlity of an existing plugin.</p>

<h3>ECommerce Application</h3>

<p class="todo">This example illustrates how
Apache Forrest can be embedded in a Wicket web application (Wicket is 
a Java web application framework. The Wicket
application handles all dynamic funtions, such as the management of a
shopping cart and "clever" Ajax search functionality, whilst Forrest
handles the generation of semi-static content, such as product
description pages. It builds on the previous example in which
Forrest generated content from an Product Catalogue.</p>

<p>Here we are using Wicket to generate many parts of an
HTML page, such as the navigation. This is because we happen to like
Wickets approach to the building of web pages from components. However,
with a little imagination we are sure you can see how to use your
favourite templating technology to do this. Some suggested alternatives to wicket
rendering would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>jxTemplate</li>
  <li>Tiles</li>
  <li>Cocoon</li>
  <li>Dispatcher</li>
</ul>

<p>The use of Forrest to generate content
allows us to leverage the mulitple output plugins provided by Forrest to
present content in many different formats, such as web page, PDF, voice
etc.</p>

<h3>Extended Product Catalogue</h3>

<p class="todo">We will now extend the product catalgoue to enable the embedding of
third party product feeds as well as products from our own database. To
do this we will retrieve a feed from TradeDoubler.co.uk and embed the
results in our product catalogue. This example will illustrate the
aggregation of content from multiple sources, in different source
formats into a single output document available in multiple formats.</p>
