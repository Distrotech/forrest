<title>Forrest 1 Vs Forrest 2</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>This document attempts to answer the common questins
  asked by people familiar with Forrest 1 and trying to
  understand Forrest 2.</p>
  
  <h1>Where are the *.xmap files?</h1>
  
  <p>There aren't any.</p>
  
  <p>Forrest 2 does not use Cocoon as its underlying
  framework and so we have been able to do away with
  our sitemaps.</p>
  
  <h1>So where is the processing pipeline define?</h1>
  
  <p>In Forrest 1 the processing pipeline was defined in
  the cocoon sitemap files. The sitemap language is very
  powerful, but it is also very confusing for newcomers.
  Forrest 2 recognises that since Forrest is an XML
  publishing framework all it needs to do is read an input
  (or set of inputs), convert them to the Forrest internal
  format and then process them using relevant output 
  documents. To do this we do not need the complexities of
  the sitemap.</p>
  
  <p>The processing pipeline of Forrest 2 is defined in
  forrestContext.xml. Briefly:</p>

  <p>All pipelines are, essentially, a Reader -> an Input 
  Plugin -> an Output Plugin. This is anologous to Generator
  -> Transformaer -> Serliazer in Cocoon sitemaps.</p>
  
  <p>The reader provides the source document, the input 
  plugin converts it into a document Forrest can work with
  internally, and the output Plugin produces the required
  output document.</p>
  
  <p>A client makes a query, such as "http://foo.org/bar.html".
  This is mapped to a source document URI using the locationmap
  (this process is almost identical to that in Forrest 1).
  This URI will look something like "file:foo/bar.xml" or
  "http://remote.foo.org/bar.xml".</p>

  <p>Once we have this source URI we can select a reader to 
  retrieve the document. Readers are selected based on the 
  protocol in the source URI. The protocol corresponds to 
  the bean id in forrestContext.xml.</p>

  <p>So a source of "file://foo/bar.xml" will use the reader 
  identified by &lt;bean id="file"...&gt; in forrestcontext.xml. 
  Similarly, "http://remote.foo.org/bar.xml" will use the
  reader identified by &lt;bean id="http"...&gt;.</p>

  <p>The reader produces a document encapsulated in a class 
  that exposes a getType() method. The return value of this
  method is used to select the input plugin to use. Again 
  selected on the bean id in forrestContext.xml</p>
  
  <p>Now we have the input plugin we need to get the output
  plugin. This is selected slightly differently, because 
  each output plugin may be used for many request URI's. For
  example, both "html" and "htm" extensions may indicate
  that an HTML document is required.</p>
  
  <p>In order to select the output plugin each plugin bean
  defines a "pattern" property. This property is a Regular 
  Expresion that is used to match against the original client
  request URI. The first output plugin that is discovered is
  the one that is used.</p>
  
  <p>So now we have all of our pipeline compoenents and 
  processing can proceed.</p>
