<title>URL Extensions</title>

<body>
<p>It is common to use extensions in URLs to indicate the
type of document required. For example, URLs ending with
"*.html" or "*.htm" usually return an HTML document. With
Forrest the use of extensions is not necessary, we can
use any pattern matching technique, for example, "html/foo"
or "web/foo" could be used to return HTML pages.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Forrest does use a few special URL
extensions to indicate special types of request. These are
used to retrieve documents from various stages of the processing
pipeline and to retrieve debug information about the
pipeline. These extensions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li class="todo">*.forrestSource - will return the document directly from
  the reader, that is with no processing at all</li>
  <li class="todo">*.forrestInternal - will return the document after
  it has been processed by the input plugins</li>
</ul>

<p class="todo">We need to make these extensions configurable. 
Perhaps from the forrestContext.xml file. This would mean the 
controller will need to be loaded via spring and Forrest core
will require a bootstrap class to initialise everything. This
would probably be a good idea as it will allow different 
controllers to be created should the need arise.</p>
