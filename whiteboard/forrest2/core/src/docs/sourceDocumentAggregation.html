<title>Source Document Aggregation</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>It is common to want to aggregate the contents of multiple 
documents into a single source document. There are a number
of ways of achieving this, such as XInclude or the document()
method in XSLT. Forrest 2 provides its own aggregation 
mechanism to augment such techniques.</p>

<p>We can define an aggregation in the locationmap/xml file.
For example:</p>

<source><![CDATA[
  <location regexp="(.*).html">
    <aggregate>
      <source href="classpath:/xdocs/navigation/$(1).xml"/>
      <source href="classpath:/xdocs/navigation/site.xml"/>
      <source href="classpath:/xdocs/$(1).xml" required="true"/>
      <source href="classpath:/xdocs/$(1).metadata.xml"/>
    </aggregate>
  </location>
]]></source>

</body>
</html>
