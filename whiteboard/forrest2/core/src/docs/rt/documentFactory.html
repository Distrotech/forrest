<title>Document Factory</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>The org.apache.forrest.core.document.DocumentFactory
  class is responsible for providing the type of document
  when a reader has retrieved it from the source URL.
  Clearly, there is an unlimited number of potential
  document types that Forrest can process. It is therefore
  necessary to be able to configure the DocumentFactory 
  without touching the Java code. This document describes how
  this configuration is performed.</p>
  
  <h1>A First Example</h1>
  
  <source><![CDATA[
  <type id="org.apache.forrest.image.jpgeg"/>
    <mime-type id="image/jpeg"/>
  </type>
  ]]></source>
  
  <h1>A Valid XML Exmple</h1>
  
  <p>Using the mime tyoe works well where the mime-type 
  uniquely identifies the document type, however, this is
  not always the case. For example, an XML document is
  always identified by the mime-type "application/xml".
  We therefore need a way of identifying the specific 
  document type in such cases.</p>
  
  <p>For XML documents we are often provided with a reference
  to a DTD that defines the XML document type. We can use this
  information to define the document type within Forrest. For
  example:</p>
     
  <source><![CDATA[
  <type id="org.apache.forrest.xdoc2"/>
    <mime-type id="application/xml"/>
    <public-id="http://forrest.apache.org/dtd/document-v20.dtd"/>
  </type>
  ]]></source>
  
  <p>The above definition says that when an XML document is
  discovered we should look to see if there is a reference
  to a DTD with the public ID of 
  "-//APACHE//DTD Documentation V2.0//EN".
  If there is such a reference in a doctype definition then
  we have identified the XML document type with the ID
  "org.apache.forrest.xdoc2".</p>
  
  <h1>A XML Exmple (no DTD)</h1>
  
  <p>Using the Doctype definition is fine if the document is
  well formed, but it is not a requirement for an XML document
  to be well formed. We therefore need a way of identifying
  a document type when the XML source does not contain a DTD.</p>
  
  <p>Unfortunately, there is no guarenteed method for
  identifying such an XML document. The best we can do is
  look at the struture of the document and infer the
  type from what we find. For example:</p>
    
  <source><![CDATA[
  <type id="org.foo.bar"/>
    <mime-type id="application/xml"/>
    <root>
      <name>rootElement</name>
    </root>
  </type>
  ]]></source>
  
  <p>This definition simply looks at the root element of
  the document and, if a match is found then we have identified
  the document type. Clearly, this could result in false matches
  where two document types have the same root element. We
  therefore need a way of further refining the document structure
  definition. For example:</p>
  
  <source><![CDATA[
  <type id="org.foo.bar"/>
    <mime-type id="application/xml"/>
    <root>
      <name>root</name>
      <attribute name="id"/>
      <attribute name="url"/>
    </root>
  </type>
  ]]></source>
  
  <p>This definition expects to see a root element called
  "root" with  an "id" and a "url" attibute.</p>
  
  <p>A different refinement would be:</p>
  
  <source><![CDATA[
  <type id="org.foo.bar"/>
    <mime-type id="application/xml"/>
    <root>
      <name>root</name>
      <children>
        <element>
          <name>child1</name>
        </element>
        <element>
          <name>child2</name>
          <attribute name="colour"/>
        </element>
      </children>
    </root>
  </type>
  ]]></source>
  
  <p>This definition expects a root element with the name
  "root" and two child elements named "child1" and "child2".
  These elements need not be in this order, but they must
  both be present. The "child2" element must have an id
  with the name "colour".</p>
