<h3>Affiliates Product Catalogue</h3>

<p class="todo">In this example we create an input plugin to use
product feeds from affiliate programs (in this case
TradeDoubler). This is then coupled with an output plugin
that presents this data as an HTML page for inclusion in
a web site.</p>

<h4>About the Product Feed</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.tradedoubler.com">Trade Doubler</a> is an 
affiliate programme in which some members provide XML feeds 
of their products. To retrieve these feeds you will need to 
register on the tradedoubler site. However, in order to see
this example in action we have provided a sample document
in <span class="source">src/examples/affiliateProductCatalogue/src/xdocs/exampleFeed.xml</span>.</p>

<h4>Creating a TradeDoubler Reader</h4>

<p>TradeDoubler XML feeds are not Valid XML documents, that
is they do not have a DTD definition within them. This means
that we have to create a Reader to read these documents for 
us and assign a type to them so that Forrest knows how to 
process them in subsequent stages.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Forrest core provides a ChainedReader class that
allows a reader to be placed before another. The ChainedReader
can be used to perform processing on a document after it is read
by another reader. For example, we can create a chained reader that
will add a given document type to a document after it has been read
by some other reader.</p>

<p>To define our ChainedReader we need to add the following to
forrestContext.xml:</p>

<p class="code"><![CDATA[
	<bean id="tradeDoubler"
		class="org.apache.forrest.reader.ChainedReader">
          <property name="docType" value="org.apache.forrest.example.affiliateProductCatalogue.TradeDoublerProductFeed"/>
        </bean>
]]></p>

<p>This reader is invoked with the pseudo protocol of "tradeDoubler" 
and returns a document with the type
<span class="source">org.apache.forrest.example.affiliateProductCatalogue.TradeDoublerProductFeed</span>.
We will need to use this type value to select the correct
input plugin to use.</p>


<p>Now we need to define which client requests will invoke this reader.
Lets add a locationmap entry to read our example feed:</p>

<p class="code"><![CDATA[
  <location regexp="tradeDoubler.*">
    <source href="tradeDoubler:classpath:/xdocs/exampleFeed.xml"/>
  </location>
]]></p>

<p>Notice how we use the <span class="source">tradeDoubler</span> psuedo protocol
to tell Forrest which reader to use and that, in this case, it is chained to a
classpath reader. The source could define any kind of reader that is available, for
example:</p>

<p class="code"><![CDATA[
  <location regexp="tradeDoubler.*">
    <source href="tradeDoubler:http://foo.org/bar.xml"/>
  </location>
]]></p>


<h5>Checking our Progress</h5>

<p>At this point we can check everything works. We should be
able to retrieve our source document by requesting 
<span class="source">tradeDoubler.forrestSource</span>. We'll
 use the CLI to test this.</p>

<p class="code">
cd [FORREST_HOME]/src/examples/afiliateProductCatalogue
java -jar [FORREST_HOME]/forrest.jar org.apache.forrest.cli.CLI tradeDoubler.forrestSource
</p>

<h4>Creating the Input Plugin</h4>

<p class="note">A more complete description of creating an Input
plugin is provided in the <a href="createAPlugin.html">Create a Plugin</a>
How To.</p>

<p>Since the TradeDoubler feeds are XML our input plugin is just
a standard XSL transformation. Such plugins can be created without
having to write any Java code, but we will, of course, need
an XSLT file to convert from the XML product feed to Forrests
internal format.</p>

<p>Our XSLT is found in <span class="source">src/examples/affiliateProductCatalogue/src/xslt/tradeDoublerFeed-to-internal.xsl</span>
to define our input plugin we just need to add the following to
forresContext.xml</p>

<p class="code"><![CDATA[
	<bean id="org.apache.forrest.example.affiliateProductCatalogue.TradeDoublerProductFeed"
		class="org.apache.forrest.core.plugin.XSLTInputPlugin">
		<property name="xsltURL"
			value="/src/xslt/tradeDoublerFeed-to-internal.xsl" />
	</bean>
]]></p>

<p>Note how we use an ID that is the same as the document type
created by our reader.</p>

<h5>Checking our Progress</h5>

<p>Now we can check that the internal document generation
works OK. We should be
able to retrieve our internal document by requesting 
<span class="source">tradeDoubler.forrestInternal</span>. 
Use the CLI to test this:</p>

<p class="code">
cd [FORREST_HOME]/src/examples/afiliateProductCatalogue
java -jar [FORREST_HOME]/forrest.jar org.apache.forrest.cli.CLI tradeDoubler.forrestInternal
</p>

<h>Generating HTML</h>

<p>Since an HTML output plugin is only an XSLT transformation
we need only configure a version of the XSLTOutputPlugin. To do
this we need to add the following to our forrestContext.xml:</p>

<p class="code"><![CDATA[
	<bean id="htmlOutputPlugin"
		class="org.apache.forrest.core.plugin.XSLTOutputPlugin">
		<property name="pattern" value=".*(html|htm)" />
		<property name="xsltPath"
			value="/xdocs/samples/xslt/internal-to-html.xsl" />
	</bean>
]]></p>

<p class="todo">The above location of the xsltPath will need
to change to someting more permanent.</p>

<p>In this case the id attribute, unlike with readers and 
input plugins, can be any unique value. The pattern property
defines which request URLs should be processed by this output
plugin. In this case, any URL ending in either "html" or 
"htm" will be processed by this plugin. This property
is a Regular Expression so you can define some very complex
pattern matching rules here.</p>

<h5>Checking our Progress</h5>

<p>Now we can check that the html document generation
works OK. We should be
able to retrieve our html document by requesting 
<span class="source">tradeDoubler.html</span>. 
Use the CLI to test this:</p>

<p class="code">
cd [FORREST_HOME]/src/examples/afiliateProductCatalogue
java -jar [FORREST_HOME]/forrest.jar org.apache.forrest.cli.CLI tradeDoubler.html
</p>

<p>Whilst we are at it, lets check the other potential URL for
this document:</p>

<p class="code">
cd [FORREST_HOME]/src/examples/afiliateProductCatalogue
java -jar [FORREST_HOME]/forrest.jar org.apache.forrest.cli.CLI tradeDoubler.htm
</p>
