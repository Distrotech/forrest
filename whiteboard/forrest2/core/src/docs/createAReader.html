<title>How to Create a Reader</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Readers are te first stage in the processing pipeline. They read
the source document for subsequent processing. It is worth noting that a
reader may no actually read a file, it may generate the files content
dynamically. This document describes how to create a new reader.</p>

<h2>Chained Readers</h2>

<p>Chained readers are the type of reader you will most often use.
A Chained reader provides a means of pre and/or post processing a
document retrieved from some other reader. It is commonly used when you
need to retrieve a document whose type cannot be identified from the raw
source alone.</p>
 
<p>A Chained Reader is defined in forrestContext.xml as follows:</p>
 
 <source><![CDATA[
 <bean id="fooProtocol" 
       class="org.apache.forrest.core.reader.ChainedReader" >
    <property name="docType" value="org.foo.Bar" /> 
 </bean>
]]></source>
 
<p>We can then define a chain of readers in the locationmap 
like this:</p>
 
<source><![CDATA[
 <location pattern="classpath/foo.*"> 
   <source href="fooProtocol:classpath:/xdocs/exampleFeed.xml"/>
 </location>
 
 <location pattern="file/foo.*"> 
   <source href="fooProtocol:file:/xdocs/exampleFeed.xml"/> 
 </location>
 
 <location pattern="http/foo.*"> 
   <source href="fooProtocol:http:/xdocs/exampleFeed.xml"/> 
 </location>
]]></source>

<h2>Java Readers</h2>

<p>If you want to do complex processing in order to generate the
source document you can create a Java class to carry out thge necessary
processing. This is really easy, simply extend <span class="code">org.apache.forrest.core.reader.AbstractReader</span>
and implement <span class="code">public AbstractSourceDocument
read(IController controller, URI requestURI, final Location location)</span>.
For example:</p>

<p class="code">![CDATA[ public AbstractSourceDocument
read(IController controller, URI requestURI, Location location) throws
MalformedURLException, ProcessingException { String content =
"&lt;example&gt;&lt;document&gt;&lt;/example&gt;"; String type =
"org.apache.forrest.example"; XMLSourceDocument doc = new
XMLSourceDocument(content, type); return doc; } ]]></p>

<p>If your reader needs to do some initialisation before it executes
the read method you should override <span class="code">public
void init()</span>.</p>
