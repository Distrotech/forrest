  <h1>Debugging Content Objects</h1>
  
  <p>Forrest2 provides some special url extensions that
  allow a Content Object developer to debug the processing
  a request undergoes. This document provides an overview
  of these extensions.</p>
  
  <p>In all cases you simply add the extension to the request
  URL you are working with.</p>
  
  <h2>.forrestPipeline</h2>
  
  <p>A request with this extension will return an XML
  representation of the pipeline executed in order to 
  create the document request.</p>
  
  <h2>.forrestSource</h2>
  
  <p>A request with this extension will return the source
  document read by Forrest2.</p>
  
  <h2>.forrestInternal</h2>
  
  <p>A request with this extension will return the 
  document produced when Forrest has finished processing the
  source with the relevant internal plugins.</p>
