<title>Building and Editing Forrest2 in Eclipse</title>
</head>
<body>

<p class="note">These are just rough notes for now, please ask
questions on the Dev list if you need to. If you can make these
notes clearer then that will help too.</p>

<p>You need the <a href="http://www.jayasoft.org/ivyde">IvyDE 
plugin</a></p>

<p>Once you installed that you need to right click on the 
ivy.xml file and select "add Ivy Library". This will add a 
special Eclipse classpath entry for the ivy dependencies.</p>

<p>I think you will also need to set the path to the 
ivyconf.xml file in the projects properties (right click 
on the project, and select IVY).</p>

<p>To update the dependencies, right click on the ivy.xml 
Library entry in the package explorer and select "Resolve".</p>
