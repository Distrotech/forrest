    <h1>Compiling</h1>
    <h2>Publish Forrest2 Core</h2>

    <p>NOTEL: There is currently a bug in the system that means you need to copy the 
    core/main/xdocs directory into WEB-INF/classes in the deployed webapp. These files
    are part of the forrest.*.jar file in WEB-INF lib, but for some reason they are not
    being picked up by the XSLTOutputPlugin class</p>
    
    <h1>Running</h1>
