Much of this plugin comes from Cocoons db block 
it is part of an attempt to automatically enable
cocoon blocks to become Forrest plugins.

As it stands it does work, although some 
configuration may be necessary that I have 
forgotten about so if you can't get the samples
working just email the dev list.
