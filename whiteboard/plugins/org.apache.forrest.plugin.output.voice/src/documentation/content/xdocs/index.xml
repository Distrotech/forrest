      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>
        This plugin will allow to read site content by computer voice and
        navigate throug it via speech. At this early stage of development, this
        plugin will work only for very simple site with non-structured sections.
      </p>

        See <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=112056193400004">initial
        proposal</a> and other discussion on dev mailing list around July 2005.

      <title>Requirements</title>
      <p>
        You should have browser which supports X+V technology. I can recommend
        <a href="ext:opera">Opera</a>, I think it's the best solution for now.
        After you download it you should enable voice in options by selecting
        "tools -> preferences -> advanced tab -> voice (left navigation) ->
        check Enable voice options", this will download voice libraries. Then
        you are able to process <code>.mxml</code> files
      </p>
      <p>
        More information on how to install <a href="ext:opera/voice">voice
        support in opera</a>.
      </p>
      <warning>
        Opera with Voice is currently not available for Linux.
      </warning>
      <note>
        Important: You can use this plugin only in dynamic mode (forrest run).

    <section id="usage">
      <title>Usage</title>
      <p>
        Currently, there is no visual output at all. After loading
        <code>.mxml</code> file the browser will start reading the first
        section. <a href="index.mxml">Try it by reading this file</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can interrupt reading by pressing "Print Screen" key. Once you have
        interupted reading you can issue a voice command as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>go to next</em> - skip to next section</li>
        <li><em>go back</em> - skip to previos section</li>
        <li>a number - skip to section with specific number</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you don't interrupt voice output, the reading will automatically
        continue to next section after 2 seconds. If you say a bad number (out
        of range), you will be prompted for correct one.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is all for now...
