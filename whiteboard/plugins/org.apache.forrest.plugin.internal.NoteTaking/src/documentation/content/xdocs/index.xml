      <title>Adding a Notes Section</title>
      <p>A notes section is provided by a contract called 
      <code>content-noteTaking</code>. See the 
      <a href="/ls.contracts.project.html">contract documentation</a>
      for an example of how to include this contract in your pages.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Configuration</title>
      <p>As can be seen above, the physical representation of the notes field
      is controlled by the contract definition in your structurer file. In addition,
      There are various non-visual aspects of this plugin can be configured
      by the site designer.
      The table below lists the properties that may be configured and their 
      defaults. To change a property add it to your 
      <code>forrest.properties.xml</code> file.</p>
      
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Property Name</th>
          <th>Description</th>
          <th>Default</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>noteTaking.repository.URL</td>
          <td>The URL of the repository for notes. It should end with a '/'.</td>
          <td>PLUGIN_DIR/src/notes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>noteTaking.filename</td>
          <td>The name of the file that will contain notes.</td>
          <td>notes.xml</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      
      <warning>
        Defaults are not currently implemented. They are waiting on 
        <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-739">this issue</a>.
        However, the forrest.properties.xml file is present in the plugin
        directory and will should start working once the above issue is
        resolved. In the meantime, projects should define the above properties.
