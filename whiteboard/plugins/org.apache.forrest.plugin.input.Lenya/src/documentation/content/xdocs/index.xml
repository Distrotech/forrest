    <title>Welcome to the org.apache.forrest.plugin.input.Lenya Plugin</title> 
  </header> 
  <body> 
    <section>
      <title>Apache Forrest - org.apache.forrest.plugin.input.Lenya Plugin</title>
      <p>This plugin retrieves documents from a 
      <a href="http://lenya.apache.org">Lenya</a>
      repository.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Usage</title>
      
      <p>Perhaps the most important thing to realise about this plugin is that 
      there is no relationship between the Forrest URL space and the URL space
      defined in the Lenya repository. That is the path to and the name of each
      document within Forrest needs not be the same as the path to and the name
      of the document within the Lenya repository.</p>
      
      <p>This enables the repository to be structured in a way that is
      appropriate for it's editors and the Forrest document collection can
      be structured in a way that is appropriate for the target audience. In
      fact, it is possible to use the same document from a Lenya repository in
      multiple Forrest collections each using a completely different URL 
      space that is custom designed for the end user of the document
      collection.</p> 
      
      <section>
        <title>Locationmap</title>
      
        <p>In order to tell Forrest which document to retrieve from the
        repository you need to make use of the locationmap in Forrest. Your
        project must therefore provide a locationmap similar to the one 
        that follows.</p>
      
        <source><![CDATA[
<locationmap xmlns="http://apache.org/forrest/locationmap/1.0">

  <components>
    <matchers default="lm">
      <matcher 
        name="lm" 
        src="org.apache.forrest.locationmap.WildcardLocationMapHintMatcher"/>
    </matchers>
  </components>
  
  <locator>
   
     <match pattern="index.xml">
         <location src="http://127.0.0.1:18888/default/live/index.xml" />
     </match>	
     <match pattern="lenya-site.xml">
       <location src="cocoon://lenya-site.xml"/>
     </match>
     <match pattern="lenya/**.xml">
       <location src="http://127.0.0.1:18888/default/live/{1}.xml"/>
     </match>
     
  </locator>
</locationmap>
        ]]></source>
        
        <p>The first match (<code>pattern="index.xml"</code>) will redirect
        the request for index.xml to a named document
        in the Lenya repository. If you provide your index.xml file locally then omit 
        this matcher.</p>
        
        <note>In a future version of Forrest it planned to allow plugins to provide 
        locationmaps of their own. Therefore, the need for a project to provide this
        locationmap will be removed.</note>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <title>Retrieveing Lenya Documents</title>
        <p>To retrieve a lenya document simply request
        http://localhost:8888/lenya/PATH/TO/FILE.html.</p>

        <note>It is intended that his need to fix the urlspace as lenya/**
        will be removed in a future version of the plugin</note>
