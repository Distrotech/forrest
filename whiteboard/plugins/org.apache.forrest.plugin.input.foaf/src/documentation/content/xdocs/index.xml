         <title>FOAF index</title>
         <p>This plugin can also be used to aggregate FOAF documents from various sources. 
         To index and view FOAF documents using this plugin, add the URIs of the FOAF documents in <code>samples/foafIndex.xml</code>. 
         Since the FOAF data can be obtained from anywhere you want, the FOAF data is assured to be kept up to date. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Add an "id" for the person and the locaction of that person's FOAF file as shown below. The "id" will be used in indexing the FOAF data.</p>
         <p>Example:</p>
         <source>
            <![CDATA[
   <people>
      <person id="johnDoe" location="http://example.com/john/foaf.rdf" />
      <person id="janeDoe" location="http://example.com/jane/foaf.rdf" />
   </people>
   ]]>
        </source>
        
        
      <p>A working example for FOAF files indexing to explore the FOAF data
       can be found <a href="people/index.html">here</a>.</p>
