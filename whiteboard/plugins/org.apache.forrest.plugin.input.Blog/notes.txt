This plugin exists to explore actually *using* metadata in Forrest.  We have long had "meta" elements that are being put to use.  For ease of development, the plugin explores the issues using an XPathDirectoryGenerator, but the concepts would generally apply to any source that supports xpath queries.  

The "blog" is only important because it is generally understood by folks and thus not alot of explanations of the use-case are necessary.  The idea of really using metadata within Forrest applies to many more use-cases than just a weblog.

The scope is using metadata for some purpose, it isn't limited to the simplistic "meta" elements.  

Goals for now:
o) Dynamically generate lists of articles relevant to a certain "category".  It must support the reality of many-to-many relationships between "articles" and "categories".

o) Get the site.xml to support displaying context with these articles.  For example, if there is an article XYZ that belongs to both categories "News" AND "Sports".  If a user navigates to that article XYZ through the clicking on the "News" category, then the menu's "selected" should be on the "News" category.  However, if the article was navigated to from the "Sports" category, then the "Sports" menu should be "selected".

o) Allow for "related content/topics".  One should be able to include in the metadata that a particular article "relates to" another article (as in "Related" or "See also").
