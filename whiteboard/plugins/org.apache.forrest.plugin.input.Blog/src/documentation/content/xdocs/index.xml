      <title>Samples</title>
      <p>In the menu on the left side of the page is a link to "Web Blog".  Under there you will 
      find a couple sample blog categories.  Click on one of them and an index comes up with all
      articles listed for that category.</p>
      <p>Try it out by opening a blog entry (e.g. /blog/entry1.xml) and adding or changing the category
      from or to "News" or "Sports".

    <section id="why">
      <title>Why is this interesting?</title>
      <p>Ok, so this isn't the most powerful blogging software out there but it's interesting because
      it demonstrates using an XPathDirectory generator to publish indices of articles.  If 
      you want an article listed on multiple pages, just add the appropriate "meta" entry for it with
      the appropriate category.</p>
      
      <p>In that sense, a Blog becomes just another use-case for metadata driven indices. Several other 
      use-cases that might follow a similar approach once fleshed out:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Product catalogs where each product might belong to more than one category.</li>
        <li>Product documentation where each document may apply to more than one version of the product.</li>
        <li>News site where each article might fall under more than one category.</li>
      </ul>
