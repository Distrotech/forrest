        This section includes links to a number of samples using this plugin.
        The plugin is intended to be self documenting through these samples. If
        you require further help please ask on the user mailing list.

      <p>
        You can make this plugin aware of the FOAF file by listing in the <code>locationmap</code>.
        A sample entry would be as follows: (You can also give the URL of the FOAF file for <code>
        location src</code>, instead of placing the FOAF file in the <code>xdocs/samples/</code> and 
        giving the relative path there.)
