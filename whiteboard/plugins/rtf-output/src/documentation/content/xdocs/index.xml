      <title>How to Use the RTF Plugin</title>
      <p>
        Currently, there is no auto-install feature for the RTF plugin since it
        is pre-alpha. For installation instructions see the
        <code>README.txt</code> file.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have the RTF plugin installed, it is simply a case of
        requesting a file with an rtf extension. For example,
        <a href="samples/minimal.rtf">samples/minimal.rtf</a>.
      </p>
      <warning>
        Currently, the Forrest generated fo files are not working in this RTF
        plugin. See the <a href="todo.html">To Do List</a> for more details.
