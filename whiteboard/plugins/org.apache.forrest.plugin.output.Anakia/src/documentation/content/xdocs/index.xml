        Produce output in
        <a href="http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/anakia.html">Apache Velocity Anakia</a>
        "xdoc" format, for example
        <a href="site:sample-1">localhost:8888/index.xdoc</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        One use of this plugin is to export a Forrest-based site to Anakia
        "xdoc".
      </p>
      <p>
        Forrest can then be used as normal, to draw together source content
        in various formats, and export a set of consistent documents.

      <title>Howto</title>
      <p>
        You need a link from each page to its .xdoc version. The
        easiest way to do that is with the new whiteboard
        <a href="http://forrest.apache.org/pluginDocs/dev/org.apache.forrest.plugin.internal.dispatcher/">Dispatcher</a>
        functionality. Follow the "Quickstart" document. Edit your new structurer panels to add
        a new contract "content-anakia-link" following the existing "content-pdf-link".
        A contract is provided in the o.a.f.plugin.output.Anakia plugin at
        resources/themes/common/html/content-anakia-link.ft to copy to the same place in your project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't forget to declare the o.a.f.plugin.output.Anakia plugin (and the usual Dispatcher
        plugins) in your project's forrest.properties file.
