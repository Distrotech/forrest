      <title>Apache Forrest - org.apache.forrest.plugin.output.Anakia Plugin</title>
      <p>
        Produce output in
        <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/docs/anakia.html">Anakia</a>
        "xdoc" format, i.e. localhost:8888//index.xdoc
      </p>
      <p>
        One use of this plugin is to export a Forrest-based site to Anakia "xdoc".
        Forrest can then draw together source content in various formats and export
        a set of consistent documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        To do that you need a link from each page to its .xdoc version.
        The easiest way to do that is with the new Dispatcher functionality.
        A contract is provided at resources/themes/common/html/content-anakia-link.ft
      </p>
      <p>
        The current "xdoc" output structure is specifically to be that
        currently used at http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/infrastructure/site
        (produces the top-level website at apache.org)
        which it seems does not have a DTD or other grammar.
