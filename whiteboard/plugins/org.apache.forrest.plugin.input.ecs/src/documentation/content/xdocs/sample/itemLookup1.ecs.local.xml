    <Source>Our Local Review</Source>
    <Content>This is a product review by our own staff. 
    This product is really fantastic. Why not buy twenty of them.
    It's got squeaky bits and eveything. It even talks with a non-descript
    American/Computer accent. Go one, you know you want to ;-)</Content>
