      <h>Apache Forrest - org.apache.forrest.plugin.internal.xhtml2 Plugin</h>
      <p>Forrest versions prior to 0.8 used XDoc as their internal format, versions from 0.8 onwards are going to use a subset of XHTML2 instead. This plugin converts the main forrest sitemaps to work with XHTML2. We have also take the opportunity to refactor the sitemaps to use the locationmap, this gives a much cleaner set of sitemap files.</p>

      <h>Samples</h>
      <p>This section includes links to a number of samples using this plugin. The
      plugin is intended to be self documenting through these samples. If you 
      require further help please ask on the user mailing list.</p>
