      <title>Apache Forrest - org.apache.forrest.plugin.input.doap Plugin</title>
      <p>
        Renders DOAP files in a human readable form.

      <title>Project Details</title>
      <p>
        Project details are generated from a project descriptor file. This file
        can be in any of the followin formats:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>DOAP</li>
        <li>DOAP over ATOM</li>
      </ul>
      <note>
        We need your help in adding more formats.
      </note>
      <p>
        The location of this descriptor file is specified in the locationmap
        with the hint <code>doap.descriptor</code>. This defaults to a file
        clled doap.xml in the root of your projects content directory. To place
        your descriptor in a different location simply add a matcher like that
        shown below in your project locationmap file.
      </p>
      <source>
<![CDATA[
    <match pattern="doap.descriptor">
      <location src="[path/to/descriptor/file]" />
    </match>    
      ]]>
      </source>
      <p>
        To retrieve the project DOAP file in its raw form request the file
        <code>/projectDetails/source.xml</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To retrieve the project details page request the file
        <code>/projectDetails.[FORMAT]</code>.
      </p>
      <section>
        <title>Multiple Projects</title>
        <p>
          You can use the projectInfo plugin to pull together project
          information for multiple projects. For example, take a look at the
          project details for <a href="projectDetails/forrest.html">Apache
          Forrest</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the locatoinmap you can retrieve this content from anywhere you
          want, for example, the DOAP file for the Forrest project comes from
          directly from SVN, thus we are always assured of it being up to date.
        </p>
        <p>
          To retrieve the project details of another project make a request for
          <code>projectDetails/[PROJECT_NAME].html</code>. For
          this to work your project locationmap must have an entry like this:
        </p>
        <source>
<![CDATA[    
    <match pattern="doap.descriptor.forrest">
      <location src="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/trunk/site-author/content/doap.xml"/>
    </match>    
        ]]>
        </source>
        <warning>
          FOR-910 "project DOAP file retrieved numerous times during docs
          generation" so use a local copy instead.
        </warning>
        <p>
          Of course, if you have a central location for all your project
          descriptor files you could use a match like this:
        </p>
        <source>
<![CDATA[    
    <match pattern="doap.descriptor.*">
      <location src="path_to_descriptors/{1}.xml"/>
    </match>    
        ]]>
        </source>
        <warning>
          The indexing of projects (described below) does not currently work
          with wildcard matchers in the locationmap.
        </warning>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Project Indexes</title>
        <p>
          The system will automatically create an index of projects from your
          projects locationmap file. For example, the "Projects" section of the
          navigation on the left is automatically generated.
        </p>
        <note>
          There is considerable repetition in the indexes in this demo. The
          intention is to show the range of indexes that can be created. You
          should select the most suitable for your individual project.
        </note>
        <warning>
          The indexes to be included in your site navigation only work correctly
          when generating a static site. You should only use page based indexes
          for dynamic sites.
        </warning>

        <title>Dispatcher</title>
        <p>
          The DOAP plugin provides dispatcher templates for working with DOAP
          files. For usage instructions see the docs for the
          <a href="/ls.contracts.org.apache.forrest.plugin.input.doap.html">doap
          templates</a>.
