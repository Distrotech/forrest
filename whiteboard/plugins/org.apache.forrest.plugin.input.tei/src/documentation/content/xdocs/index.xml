        <warning>This document is auotmatically generated by the TEI ouptut plugin.
        Both the output and input plugins are whiteboard status, i.e. they are not
        feature complete yet - please help us to improve these plugins. You should
        be aware that some of the elements look like they are being correctly
        processed, when in fact they are simply being passed thorough by both
        the input and output plugins (warnings, notes and fixmes for example).
        Examine the TEI source document for validation.</warning></li>
      </ul>
      
      <note>The more samples included here the easier it is for users to
      understand this plugin. If you can provide additional samples please
      do so.</note>
