    <title>DevTools Plugin</title>
  </header>
  <body>
    <p>
      The devtools plugin provides a number of useful commands for use when
      developing Forrest based content objects. It is only useful in dynamic
      mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      This plugin introduces the concept of three different stages of
      publication. To be useful it is important that you understand each of
      these stages.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Local Preview: this is a transient verson of a page that can be
          viewed in the local browser. It is not saved and is not recoverable
          once you stop the current forrest run.</li>
      <li>Local Staging: this is a local permanent store of a page or collection
          of pages. The pages are retrievable after you stop the current forrest run.</li>
      <li>Deployed: this is a remote permanent store of a page or collection of
          pages. This may be a live web server or a remote staging server used for
          quality assurance before the content goes live.</li>
    </ol>
    <section>
      <title>Available Tools</title>
      <ul>
        <li>
              Save a locally previewed page to the local staging area. 
              e.g. <link href="/devTools/do/savePage.html?URI=index.html">save this page</link> and check the timestamps on 
              <code>PROJECT_HOME/build/site/index.html</code></li>
<!--
            <li>
              <link href="/devTools/do/siteBuild.html">Build the complete content object in the local staging area</link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <link href="/devTools/do/deployFromLocalStaged.html">Deploy the locally staged site</link>
            </li>
