    <h1>WYSIWYG Editing In Apache Forrest</h1>
    <p>
      This plugin provides
      <span style="font-style: italic;">WYSIWYG</span>
      editing for the Apache Forrest appliction. It currently only works with
      HTML input files, but we hope to extend its range of supported file
      formats.
    </p>
    <p>
      This plugin uses
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/itools-htmlarea/">HTML Area</a>
      for the editing widget.
    </p>
    <warning>
      With the current configuration this plugin produces HTML with embedded
      style information (not just CSS stuff). A future version will only use CSS
      styling, but for now be aware that the source can be bad from a separation
      of content and style perspective
    </warning>
    <h2>Try it out</h2>
    <h1>How do I allow users to edit my Pages?</h1>
    <p>
      If a request is recieved with an URL that contains "edit_htmlArea/" then
      an edit page is generated for the indicated page. For example:
    </p>
    <p class="source">
      &lt;a href="/edit_htmlArea/index.html"&gt;edit index&lt;/a&gt;
    </p>
    <p>
      will create an editor for the <code>index.html</code> page.
