<!-- The data -->
<data>
<!-- v is value (datapoint) -->
  <v>
<!-- y is y-value
			 x is x-value. 
			 If one of these is not specified, some default value can be calculated.
			 If, for example, not one x value is specified for the whole dataset, 
			 they will be placed on regular intervals.
			 x-values are necessary for defining scatterplots, for example.
			 z-values might also be possible -->
    <y>80</y>
<!-- c stands for "content". This can be used for defining tooltips, for example -->
    <c>(1990,North) = 80</c>
<!-- l stands for "link". Format of the link should be investigated further (I suspect
			this format is too much html-oriented) -->
    <l>/1990/North</l>
  </v>
  <v>
    <y>77.6</y>
<!-- Emphasize:
			if it's a pie chart, let this piece jump out.
			Other charts could provide other emphasizing mechanisms,
			maybe even dependent on the "style" sheet
