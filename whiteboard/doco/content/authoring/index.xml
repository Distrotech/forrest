    <h1>Welcome to doco</h1>
    <p>
      This publication is created with the aim to be a generic documentation
      publication for Apache wide usage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first projects to test it are the Apache Forrest and the Apache Lenya
      project.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea is to manage the content via the Apache Lenya CMS and export it
      via Apache Forrest.
    </p>
