How to get PDF images working in Forrest
----------------------------------------

Forrest uses Apache FOP for rendering images.  FOP cannot handle all image
types natively, and requires third-party jars to be added.  For an overview,
see:

http://xml.apache.org/fop/graphics.html

Specifically, to get PNGs working in PDFs, download Jimi from 

http://java.sun.com/products/jimi/

Then unpack the distribution and copy JimiProClasses.zip to
lib/core/jimi-1.0.jar.

(due to Sun's licensing, we cannot redistribute Jimi with Forrest)
