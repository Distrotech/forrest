                          ============================

1) Introduction
---------------

This file documents the 0.2.1 maintenance release of Apache Forrest.  The
release notes for 0.2 (see RELEASE-NOTES-0.2.txt) apply to this release, and
are not duplicated here.  Bug 7.1 has been fixed.


2) Changes since 0.2
--------------------

- Fixed bug where the webapp would break due to missing XML jars under JDK
  1.2/1.3.

- Fixed a bug where multiple menu entries are highlighted if the filenames
  share a common prefix.

- Fixed a bug in forrest.bat, which would fail if run from a different drive to
  that Forrest was installed in.

- Make the seed project use the correct 'built with Apache Forrest' logo
  instead of Cocoon + Centipede logos.


3) Feedback
-----------

As usual, please send all feedback to forrest-dev@xml.apache.org
