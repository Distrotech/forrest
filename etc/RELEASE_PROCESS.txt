                            Forrest Release Process
                          ============================


This file documents the steps a release manager should follow when making a new
Forrest release.

Preparations
------------

 - Ensure that as many PMC members as possible have their PGP keys in
   the KEYS file.

 - Ensure that there are no copyright issues. The committers and PMC would
   have been continually monitoring this. There are some tools to assist
   with scanning for issues, e.g.
   cvs://committers/relicense/src/perl/relicense.txt
   cvs://committers/tools/

Building the distribution
-------------------------

 - Edit module.xml and replace the '-dev' text with '' i.e. nothing:
    ...
    <project name="xml-forrest">
        <version fix="0" major="0" minor="6" tag="-dev"/>

 - Edit status.xml, remove the -dev from the current <release> tag,
   and set the release date.  Also add a new <release> for development
   on the next version  e.g. from:

    <release version="0.6-dev" date="unreleased">
      ...
 
   to:

    <release version="0.7-dev" date="unreleased">
    </release>
    <release version="0.6" date="2002-02-13">
      ...

 - Edit src/core/forrest.build.xml to update the version tag to remove
   the "-dev". there are two occurences:
   around line 29:
   <property name="version" value="0.6-dev"/>  

    around line 52:

    |                 Forrest Site Builder                  |
    |                        0.6-dev                        |
                                ^^^^

 - Create a new file, etc/RELEASE-NOTES-x.y.txt, where x.y is the version
   currently being released.  It is best to copy an earlier RELEASE-NOTES file,
   to keep a common layout.
   In this file, provide a summary of changes, and check for general accuracy.
   Scan the status.xml/changes and the Roadmap via the issues tracker,
   to find the important issues.

 - Check out a fresh copy from SVN to make sure you have no local modifications,
   especially those that might be hidden by svn:ignore settings.  Alternatively,
   run 'svn st --no-ignore' and delete any extra files.

 - Set your Java version to be the lowest specified of our supported versions.

 - Run 'build release-dist' to generate the distributions.
   - Two archives are created: apache-forrest-X.Y.tar.gz apache-forrest-X.Y.zip

 - Repeat that on a Windows machine.
   - Use the .tar.gz from the UNIX machine and .zip from the Windows machine.
   - In that way, SVN will ensure correct line-endings on all text files.

 - Understand how to sign releases and generate MD5 and PGP.
   http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/SigningReleases

 - Create a maintenance branch in SVN with
    svn copy -m "Create the x.y release branch from r#####" \
    https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/trunk \
    https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/branches/forrest_xy_branch
   where 'xy' is a compact form of the version (e.g. 04, 041, 05).
   See http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/branches/

 - Test the actual distribution on various platforms.
   - Ask all developers to test (command-line, run, and webapp).
   - Each developer can do 'build dist' and test locally. Coordinate to ensure
     that each is using the same SVN revision and that the MD5 sums match.
   - Follow the actual user instructions.
   - Use it to build some difficult sites.
   - Ensure that the compressed archives will unpack correctly.

 - If everything looks okay, and after the Vote has finished, tag SVN with
    svn copy -m "Create tag forrest_xy from release branch" \
    https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/branches/forrest_xy_branch \
    https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/tags/forrest_xy
   where 'xy' is a compact form of the version (e.g. 04, 041, 05).
   See http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/tags/D

Upload and announcement
-----------------------

 - Upload the tarballs, the KEYS file, the *.asc and *.md5 files,
   **and the RELEASE-NOTES**
   to www.apache.org at /www/www.apache.org/ dist/forrest/
   Each PMC member has a server account and belongs to the forrest group.
   The process is documented at http://cvs.apache.org/~bodewig/mirror.html

FIXME: on server do 'svn co' in /www/www.apache.org/dist/forrest/
HEAD.html README.html LICENSE.txt KEYS
   For the meantime, it is a manual scp.

 - Arrange stuff at the Archives site http://archive.apache.org/dist/forrest/

 - Edit the forrest/src/documentation/content/xdocs/mirrors.ihtml
 - Edit the Forrest home page in the "News and events" section.
 - Rebuild and publish the Forrest website as normal.

 - Wait for the various mirrors to pick up the new files.
   This has been known to take up to 10 hours. Test it via 
   http://forrest.apache.org/mirrors.cgi

 - Edit xml-site/src/documentation/content/xdocs/news.xml and record the
   announcement, and then commit the new HTML to xml-site/targets/forrest
   Note that they still use forrest-0.5.1 to build their website.

 - Send announcement email.  Typically this is sent as:
   To: dev@forrest.apache.org, user@forrest.apache.org, announce@apache.org,
       announcements@xml.apache.org
   Subject: [Announce] Apache Forrest X.Y.Z
     !! Always refer them to the mirror facility
     !! Never mention the URL www.apache.org/ dist/ in email.
   Use the template at etc/announcement.txt
   Use your spelling checker!

Cleanups
--------

 - Edit module.xml, increment the version and add a -dev tag:

    <project name="xml-forrest">
        <version fix="0" major="0" minor="7" tag="-dev"/>

 - Edit src/core/forrest.build.xml and update the version:

   around line 29:
   <property name="version" value="0.7-dev"/>  

    around line 52:
    <description>
    |                 Forrest Site Builder                  |
    |                        0.7-dev                        |



All done!
