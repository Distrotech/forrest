Subject: [Announce] Apache Forrest 0.6

Apache Forrest is pleased to release version 0.6
http://forrest.apache.org/mirrors.cgi

Apache Forrest is an XML standards-oriented documentation framework
based upon Apache Cocoon, providing XSLT stylesheets and schemas,
images and other resources. Forrest uses these to render the source
content into a website via command-line, robot, or dynamic application.

New features in this version include:

* Uses all resources in-place. No more copying to a separate
build space and so no need to back-copy your changes.
* Project sitemaps get first chance processing, then pass-through
to core sitemaps. Simplifies management of project sitemaps.
* New skins use CSS rather than tables. Old skins are deprecated.
* DTD improvements, especially addition of ubiquitous class attribute.
* Forrestbot, the robotic deployer, has been entirely re-written.
