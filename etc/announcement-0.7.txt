Subject: [Announce] Apache Forrest 0.7

Note: This development version may differ from the final announcement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Apache Forrest is pleased to release the new version: apache-forrest-0.7
http://forrest.apache.org/mirrors.cgi

Apache Forrest is a standards-based documentation framework
which uses Apache Cocoon. Forrest emphasises separation of
presentation and content, using a plugin architecture to
transform and aggregate various input sources into various
output formats. This creates a unified document collection
that can either be used as a dynamic application, or generated
at the command-line, or generated and deployed with an automated
publishing application.

New features in this version include:

* An architecture for Plugins.
