      <p>Apache Forrest is a publishing framework that transforms input from various sources into a
      unified presentation in one or more output formats. The modular and extensible plugin
      architecture is based on Apache Cocoon and relevant standards, which separates presentation
      from content. Forrest can generate static documents, or be used as a dynamic server, or be
      deployed by its automated facility.</p>
