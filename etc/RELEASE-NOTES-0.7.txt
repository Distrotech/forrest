Apache Forrest 0.7 Release Notes ... http://forrest.apache.org/

Apache Forrest is a standards-based documentation framework
which uses Apache Cocoon. Forrest emphasises separation of
presentation and content, using a plugin architecture to
transform and aggregate various input sources into various
output formats. This creates a unified document collection
that can either be used as a dynamic application, or generated
at the command-line, or generated and deployed with an automated
publishing application.
