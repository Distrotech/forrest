Apache Forrest 0.7 Release Notes ... http://forrest.apache.org/

Apache Forrest is a publishing framework that transforms
input from various sources into a unified presentation
in one or more output formats. The modular and extensible
plugin architecture is based on Apache Cocoon and relevant
standards, which separates presentation from content.
Forrest can generate static documents, or be used as a
dynamic server, or be deployed by its automated facility.

Status
------

New features in this version include:

* An architecture for Plugins which enables a smaller Forrest
core and the ability to add new features in a modular way.

Release Notes for Apache Forrest 0.7
------------------------------------

This is not a complete list of changes.
Full list: http://forrest.apache.org/docs_0_70/changes.html

Important Changes Code Base
---------------------------

* Enable sitemap plugins. Plugins allow Forrest to have 
  functionality added through the addition of small code blocks 
  (plugins). Plugins are downloaded automatically when a site that 
  requires them is built. See Extending Forrest with Plugins [Link: 
  pluginDocs/plugins_0_70/usingPlugins.html]. (RDG)
* Added org.apache.forrest.plugin.input.dtdx plugin by moving 
  functionality out of the core. Generates DTD documentation using a 
  custom Cocoon Generator. (DC) Fixes FOR-389 [Link: 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-389].
* Added a plugin to handle input documents from Microsoft 
  Excel. (RDG) Thanks to Johannes Schaefer. Fixes FOR-373 [Link: 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-373].
* Moved POD output from the common skin to its own plugin. (RFT)
* Added external plugin POD-input to allow Plain Old Documentation (POD)
  files to be included in a Forrest site. (RDG) Thanks to Ron Blaschke.
* Added a text-output plugin. (RFT) Fixes FOR-125 [Link: 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-125].
* Added photoGallery plugin. (RDG) Thanks to JÃ¶rg Werne. Fixes FOR-387
  [Link: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-387].
* The brokenlinks file now contains referer information. 
  Upgraded lib/core/cocoon.jar and added attribute "show-referrers" to 
  the Cocoon cli.xconf (DC) Thanks to Upayavira. Fixes FOR-204 [Link: 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-204].
* Merge xdocs and raw files in the same directory 
  src/document/content/xdocs (JJP)
* Enhanced the Message of the Day (MOTD) facility. See 
  skinconf.xml from a "seed" site for configuration details. Append a 
  small text string after html title. Add text to a panel on the page. 
  Select different messages depending on the URI string pattern. To use 
  it, declare skinconfig-v07-1.dtd in your skinconf.xml file. (DC)
* Reinstate error reporting for broken "site:" and "ext:" 
  links which are due to missing entries in site.xml or typos in site: 
  links. The text "error:" is also prepended. This is a workaround for 
  bug FOR-284 "link rewriting broken when linking to xml source views 
  which contain site: links". This latter issue is handled by the core. 
  However, if your project uses a Cocoon cli.xconf then you will need
  add the same "exclude" entries. (DC) Fixes FOR-284 [Link: 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-284].
* Moved status "changes" and "todo" page generation to the 
  org.apache.forrest.plugin.input.projectInfo plugin. (RDG)
* Java 1.4 is required starting with Forrest-0.7-dev (DC)

Important Changes Documentation
-------------------------------

* Added How to customize processing of html source. (DC) Thanks to
  Ferdinand Soethe. Fixes FOR-446 [Link: 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-446].
* Added How-To Run Forrest from Maven. (RDG) Thanks to Ian P. Springer.
  Fixes FOR-369 [Link: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-369].
* Added How-To Build a plugin. (RDG)
* Added HowTo about editing CSS in a WYSIWYG fashion using Mozilla 
  Firefox and its Edit-CSS plugin. (RDG) Thanks to Ferdinand Soethe.
* Rewrote example of raw content in fresh-site to correctly document
  the behaviour in 0.7. (RDG) Fixes FOR-470 [Link: 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-470].
* Removed ihtml example from fresh-site and replaced with 
  an example of embedded HTML. The use of ihtml is now deprecated in 
  favour of embedded HTML. (RDG)
* Updated How-To: How to create a PDF document for each tab to create 
  subject-specific aggregated documents. (TS)
