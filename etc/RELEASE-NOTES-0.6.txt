Apache Forrest 0.6 Release Notes ... http://forrest.apache.org/

Apache Forrest is an XML standards-oriented documentation framework
based upon Apache Cocoon, providing XSLT stylesheets and schemas,
images and other resources. Forrest uses these to render the source
content into a website via command-line, robot, or dynamic application.
For more details, please see the website at http://forrest.apache.org/

Status
------

New features in this version include:

* Uses all resources in-place. No more copying to a separate
build space and so no need to back-copy your changes.
* This provides workflow and productivity improvements.
* Project sitemaps get first chance processing, then pass-through
to core sitemaps. This simplifies management of project sitemaps.
* Project sitemaps provide easy access to the power of Apache Cocoon.
* New skins use CSS rather than tables. Old skins are deprecated.
* Skins are configurable, e.g. with colours and optional features.
* DTD improvements, especially addition of ubiquitous class attribute.
* Forrestbot, robotic build and deploy, has been entirely re-written.
