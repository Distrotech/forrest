To publish from trunk/site-author/

Do once:
# create $FORREST_HOME/deploy.svn.settings which looks like:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<project>
  <property name="deploy.svn.user" value="myApacheUsername"/>
  <property name="deploy.svn.user" value="myPassword"/>
</project>


# Make changes to sources, and then test, then commit.
# Use the forrestbot to build and then deploy to svn.apache.org ...

cd site-author
forrest -f publish.xml build
# ... verify files in build/forrest-docs
forrest -f publish.xml deploy -Ddeploy.svn.commit-message="my commit message"

FIXME: That commit message technique does not work.
The second word is treated as an ant target to be called.

Now the files are in SVN at forrest/site
Periodically the real website files are updated from there.
You do not have to do anything else.
