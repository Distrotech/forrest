1) Allow links in titles

2) Allow <br/> in titles

Nays:
Summary:

  "And while you're at it, **please** consider adding <br /> to <title>.  And
  don't flame me. I know some may abuse it, but this is a common need in
  print-publishing (to add manual, readable breaks to certain types of
  titles/subheads). I'd want to use it -- judiciously -- for pdf files and a
  limited amount in html files."


3) Allow <p>'s inside <li>
--------------------------

Summary:

Often it it would be useful to have multiple paragraphs inside a list item:

<ul>
  <li>
    <p> ...  </p>
    <p> ...  </p>
    <p> ...  </p>
  </li>
</ul>

I can see no reason why being a "list item" implies being limited to a single
paragraph.


4) Allow <ol> and <ul> inside <p>
---------------------------------
Submittor: Jeff Turner
Date: 2002-11-20
Yeas: jefft, nicolaken
Nays:
Summary:

Frequently I find myself wanting to create lists halfway through a paragraph:

<p>
Here are some main features:
<ul>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>
These features ...
</p>

Currently this is not allowed, as <ul> cannot be contained within <p>

According to that font of wisdom, dictionary.com, a paragraph is
  "one of several distinct subdivisions of a text intended to separate ideas"
and 
  "typically deals with a single thought or topic"

I think a single idea may validly be expressed with an unordered list, as
above, and thus <ul> should be allowed within <p>


-----
Update (2002-11-26):

Apparently XHTML doesn't allow lists inside paragraphs.

The reason why not might have something to do with avoiding "pernicious mixed
content":

http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/documentation/reference/html/entry.html

However, Docbook allows <itemizedlist> inside <para>, and apparently this
doesn't count as "pernicious mixed content", so I don't know what's going on.
