        Like stated in the <a href="site:documentation/skins">Skin documentation 
        file</a> the aim of the forrest skins is to provide
        many capabilities so that extra skins are not needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim of the upcoming "leather" skin is to establish a semantic
        container approach
        for div elements that we can used as a base for all upcoming skins. 
        The leather DOM will be used for "corium" the upcoming skin bot. In
        other words "corium" is based internally on leather DOM.

        The problem with the forrest skins so far have been that "only" the design changed,
        but still we had to write a completely new skin and implement all functionality.
        Then we decided to support the new developed standard regarding naming conventions for css elements.
        This standard have been developed on the <a href="http://www.oscom.org/wiki/cssnamingconventions/">
        OSCOM website</a>, where you can find some more background informations.

        "A naming convention is an attempt to systematize names in a field so 
        they unambiguously convey similar information in a similar manner."
