    <title>Extending Forrest with Plugins</title>

      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>Forrest provides the core functionality for generating documentation
      in various output formats from a range of input formats. However, it
      does not end there. Forrest can be extended through the addition of
      plugins. This document serves as an introduction to the Forrest
      plugin mechanism.</p>
  
      <section>
        <title>What plugins are available?</title>
        <p>You can run the command <code>forrest available-plugins</code> to get
        a list of the known plugins for Forrest.</p>
        
        <p>If you would like to have your own plugin added to this list then
        contact the <a href="ext:mail-lists">developer mailing list</a>.</p>

    <section>
      <title>How is a Plugin Installed?</title>
  
      <p>If a site requires one or more plugins then the site designer will 
      have named them in the <code>project.required.plugins</code> property 
      in the projects <code>forrest.properties</code> file. When Forrest 
      builds the site it will automatically discover the plugin and install 
      it. In otherwords, the user need do nothing. For example, 
      <code>project.required.plugins=org.apache.forrest.plugin.OpenOffice.org,simplified-docbook</code>
      will cause Forrest to load the plugins called "org.apache.forrest.plugin.OpenOffice.org" and
      "simplified-docbook".</p>
      
      <p>By default a new forrest project includes plugins to generate 
      PDF output from your source documents.</p>
  
      <section>
        <title>Upgrading from a Version of Forrest Without Plugins</title>
        <p>The plugin functionality was introduced in version 0.7 of Forrest.
        At this time some of the functionality previously in Forrest was
        extracted into a plugin. However, we have not broken backward 
        compatability with earlier versions. In the absence of a
        <code>project.required.plugins</code> property in the projects 
        <code>forrest.properties</code> file all plugins that contain 
        functionality previously part of Forrest itself will be loaded
        automatically. Unless you intend to use new functionality provided
        by a plugin you will not need to make any changes top your project.</p>
        
        <p>If you do require additional plugin functionality, be sure to
        include all required plugins in the 
        <code>project.required.plugins</code> property in the project's
        <code>forrest.properties</code>. You can view
        <code>main/webapp/default.forrest.properties</code>
        to see the names of plugins that provide previously core 
        functionality.</p>
        
        <p>It is also worth noting that there is a small performance 
        improvement if you remove plugins that are not in use. Therefore,
        if you do not use one or more of the plugins named in the 
        <code>project.required.plugins</code> property of 
        <code>main/webapp/default.forrest.properties</code>
        it is recomended that you override this value in your project's
        <code>forrest.properties</code> file.</p>

    <section>
      <title>Avoiding Plugin Conflicts</title>
      <p>Clashes between plugins can occur. For example, the simplified-docbook 
      and full docbook plugins may try and process the same files. In this 
      instance the one that is mounted first will take precedence. Plugins 
      are mounted in the order they appear in the 
      <code>project.required.plugins</code> property, therefore the mounting 
      order and therefore processing precedence is under user control.</p>
