      This page describes changes to Apache Forrest that affect people who are
      upgrading to the 0.7 version.
      If you have other issues, then please discuss on either the
      <link href="ext:mail-lists/forrest-dev">dev</link> or
      <link href="ext:mail-lists/forrest-user">user</link>
      mailing lists.
      As more experience is gained, this document will be updated.

      <p>
      (If you are upgrading from a version prior to 0.6 then you may want
      to see the notes for the <link href="site:upgrading_06">previous</link>
      upgrade. However you should be fine with the notes from this 0.7 document.)

      <title>Run a clean target after upgrade</title>

      Synchronise your project's skinconf.xml and forrest.properties files.
      </p>
      <p>
      Take advantage of the separation of concerns. In a new workspace,
      create a fresh
      '<code>forrest seed</code>' site, then tweak its forrest.properties
      and skinconf.xml until it reflects your old site.
      When it is ready, replace your project's skinconf.xml and
      forrest.properties files.
      Any remaining issues would concern other aspects of your configuration,
      such as site.xml and your actual content.
