    <description>Forrest provides a sound technological infrastructure for open software development for the Apache Software Foundation based on ASF software, ASF practices and experience, and modern software design principles.</description>
    <detailed>Ever seen &apos;sourceforge&apos;? ok, than you know what a technological insfrastructure for open development is. Ever seen Mozilla&apos;s &apos;tinkerbox&apos; and &apos;bonsai&apos;? ok, then you know what we mean for &apos;helping tools&apos;. Take all the wishes/dreams that you ever had when you were participating in an OSS community... well, we want Forrest to make them possible.</detailed>
    <what>
        <goal>publishing system for documentation</goal>
        <goal>analysis of logs and publishing of results</goal>
    </what>
    <why>If you ever participated in ASF open development you know why: there is always the feeling that you are left on your own, that each project, effort, community mail list and invidual has to struggle to keep up with the others    and to keep coherence. This effort was started by those who believe that a better and more coherent technical infrastructure is a first step in the right direction.</why>
