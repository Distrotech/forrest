      <title>About Locationmaps</title>
      <p>A locationmap defines a mapping from requests to location strings.</p>

      <p>It was conceived to:</p>  

      <ul>
        <li>Provide a more powerful means for semantic linking.</li>
        <li>Enable Forrest with a standard configuration override mechanism.</li>
        <li>decouple the conceptual source space used by Cocoon from
        the concrete source space, so that a change in the concrete sources
        does not impact on the sitemap</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The syntax of a locationmap resembles that of the sitemap in that it also makes use
      of Matchers and Selectors to traverse a tree of nodes towards a leaf. In the case of
      the locationmap however the leaf does not identify a pipeline but instead identifies
      a location string.</p>

      <title>Locationmap Examples</title>

        <title>Retrieving an XDoc via HTTP</title>
        
        
        <p>Normally files are generated from <code>{project:content.xdocs}</code>.
        Using the Locationmap it is possible to make these files come from elsewhere.
        This is useful if you want to pull files from different directory structures,
        oe even remote repositories.</p>
        
        <p>The target of "/remoteDemo/*.html"
        is generated from a source retrieved from the Forrest SVN.</p>
        
        <note>Because the above URL retrieves the source file from SVN it will
        only work if you are online. For this reason we have not enabled this link
        as it would stop you building this site offline. However, if you are online 
        you can enter the URL into the browesr and it will work (however, note the 
        current limitations, described below, regarding the site: and ext: protocols).</note>
        
        <p>The locationmap matcher for the link above is:</p>
        
        <source>
 &lt;match pattern="remoteDemo/**.xml"&gt;
   &lt;location src="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/trunk/site-author/content/xdocs/{1}.xml" /&gt;
 &lt;/match&gt;
        </source>
      
        <p>Note that because this is a wildcard matcher you can request any page
        from SVN simply by requesting 
        <code>/remoteDemo/PATH/TO/FILE/FILENAME.html</code>. In addition, we
        can request any other output format available via Forrest plugins.</p>
        
        <p>When including resources from remote repositories one has to
        be careful about things like <code>site</code> and <code>ext</code>
        linking. If the targets are not defined in the local 
        <code>site.xml</code> file then these links will be broken.</p>
        
        <warning>Because of the above limitation many of the links in the
        page generated from the above example are broken.</warning>

      <section>
        <title>Link Rewriting</title>
        <p>The locationmap can be used to rewrite URLs when the page is generated.
        For example, when the locationmap has:</p>
        <source>
 &lt;match pattern="rewriteDemo/**"&gt;
   &lt;location src="http://www.burrokeet.org/{1}.html" /&gt;
 &lt;/match&gt;
        </source>
        <p><a href="lm:rewriteDemo/index">This link is rewritten to
        an offsite address</a> not
        specified in the link, which has <code>href="lm:rewriteDemo/index"</code>.</p>
