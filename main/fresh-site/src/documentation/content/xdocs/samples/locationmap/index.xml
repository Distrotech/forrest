      <title>About Locationmaps</title>
      <p>A locationmap defines a mapping from requests to location strings.</p>

      <p>It was conceived to:</p>  

      <ul>
        <li>Provide a more powerful means for semantic linking.</li>
        <li>Enable Forrest with a standard configuration override mechanism.</li>
        <li>decouple the conceptual source space used by Cocoon from
        the concrete source space, so that a change in the concrete sources
        does not impact on the sitemap</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The syntax of a locationmap resembles that of the sitemap in that it also makes use
      of Matchers and Selectors to traverse a tree of nodes towards a leaf. In the case of
      the locationmap however the leaf does not identify a pipeline but instead identifies
      a location string.</p>

        <title>Generating from a Different Location</title>
        
        
        <p>Normally files are generated from <code>{project:content.xdocs}</code>.
        Using the Locationmap it is possible to make these files come from elsewhere.
        This is useful if you want to pull files from different directory structures,
        oe even remote repositories.</p>
        
        <p>The target of <a href="/remoteDemo/index.html">href="/remoteDemo/index.html"</a>
        is generated from a source retrieved from the Forrest SVN via viewSVN.</p>
        
        <note>Because the above link retrieves the source file from viewSVN it will
        only work if you are online.</note>
        
        <p>The locationmap matcher for the link above is:</p>
        
        <source>
 &lt;match pattern="remoteDemo/**.xml"&gt;
   &lt;location src="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/forrest/trunk/site-author/content/xdocs/{1}.xml" /&gt;
 &lt;/match&gt;
        </source>
      
        <p>Note that because this is a wildcard matcher you can request any page
        from viewsSVN simply by requesting 
        <code>/remoteDemo/PATH/TO/FILE/FILENAME.html</code>. In addition, we
        can request any other output format available via FOrrest plugins.</p>
        
        <p>When including resources from remote repositories one hs to
        be careful about things like <code>site</code> and <code>ext</code>
        linking. If the targets are not defined in the local 
        <code>site.xml</code> file then these links will be broken.</p>
        
        <warning>Because of the above limitation many of the links in the
        page generated from the above example are broken.</warning>

        <title>Link Rewriting</title>
        <p>The locationmap can be used to rewrite URLs when the page is generated.
        For example, when the locationmap has:</p>
        <source>
 &lt;match pattern="rewriteDemo/**"&gt;
   &lt;location src="http://www.burrokeet.org/{1}.xml" /&gt;
 &lt;/match&gt;
        </source>
        <p><a href="lm:rewriteDemo/index">This link leads is rewritten to
        an offsite address</a> not
        specified in the link, which has <code>href="lm:rewriteDemo/index"</code>.</p>
